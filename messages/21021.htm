The Twin Evils Cheese and Beard<p>
Once upon a time Baby Face (Beard) and Fresh Milk (Cheese) played Warhammer 40k Rogue Trader. They were happy gamers and enjoyed playing scenarios against each other and organizing campaigns. They loved the spirit of the game and even like dressing up as their favorite troopers when they went to Games Day.<p>
Then, one day, a new edition of Warhammer 40k came out and they rejoiced for it was much easier to play. Then disaster struck. The model designers created ‘special characters’. These mighty hero’s were incredibly detailed. Most gamers bought these and enjoyed using them in large battles and campaigns. Fresh Milk enjoyed using them too, in fact he liked them that much he used them every game. Poor old Baby Face kept getting thrashed, and so had to use them too for a while, however to keep in the spirit of the game he stopped using them. Fresh Milk like then that much that he never did stop using them and in his bid for total and unrelenting victory decided that his army had a clone machine.<p>
The next campaign Baby Face and Fresh Milk played was predictably one sided. Fresh Milk’s armies had 40 Abbadon’s (one in each army) all with Terminator bodyguards. With the characters came the exploitation of the rules. Under such conditions Baby Face gave in, his poor Orks didn’t know what to do. So it came to be, that Baby Face decided to fight fire with fire. Mail order suddenly had an order for 45 Gazkull Thrakkas, all for the same address. The campaign protracted into a stalemate.<p>
<br>
Games Day came round and Baby Face and Fresh Milk were excited, if it was going to be as good as last year they were in for a treat. However Baby Face and Fresh Milk didn’t go in costume this year and take part in the usual frolics like speed painting. What they really did was pester the games designers about pointless rule loopholes they’d found and then making life hell on the gaming tables by arguing every single rule hick-up until they were blue in the face. That day Baby Face and Fresh Milk had undergone a change which had started along time back. No more would they abide by the spirit of the game, no they had become (fanfare etc..) Beard and Cheese, the first power gamers and shadows of their former selves. The games designers were worried, a new breed of gamer had arrived.<p>
That day they raised their standard and flocks of innocent green gamers flocked to their banner, searching for the magic that is the unbeatable army. After Games Day Beard and Cheese met afterwards to decide what their plan of conquest would be over the fun loving fair players. It was decided that Cheese would go to America and continue the crusade there. Beard would remain in the UK and infiltrate the Games Workshop design studio. Power Gaming had arrived and it wasn’t just restricted to 40k, all the Games Workshop games would be defeated in time and so too would the spirit of the every Workshop player.<p>
It was not to be though. Beard did try to infiltrate the Studio, but he failed. The games designers had elected a champion in these dark times. His name was Jervis Johnson. Using his mighty power he banished Beard to the production factory forever. Beard managed to escape, but not before being tortured by hundreds of thousands of plastic core army infantry.<p>
And so that is the story of the twin evils. Nobody knows what happened to Cheese, it is rumored he has carved out a mighty nation, others say he was destroyed. Beard is still at large. Its up to you lot out there to stop these evils, or we may all suffer the consequences.<p>
Mein Kommentar:<br>
Ich benutz lieber "Bärtig" als "Regelficker"... Bärtig sagt zwar das gleiche, ist aber nicht halb so beleidigend wie Regelficker.
