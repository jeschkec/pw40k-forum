IM CJ 39 ist die oben beschriebene Armeeliste, in mehr oder weniger leicht abgewandelter Form zu finden, sie ist halbofieziell, soll heisen so ähnlich wird die einmal Liste aussehen wenn der Codex erscheint und du mußt bei Tunieren die Leitung um Einverständnis bitten wenn du mit einer solchen Armee antreten willst!<p>
Außerdem bittet dich Jervis J. um eine Stellungnahme zu der Armee wenn du mit ihr oder gegen sie gespielt hat so zu sagen als Spieletester!<p>
Die Änderungen in der Liste sind hauptsächlich in der Ausrüstung und es gibt die 10 Punkte Truppen nicht mehr!<p>

>The Harlequins are a strange sub-sect of the Eldar race, consisting of warriors from the Dark Eldar, Exodites and Craftworld Eldar. They are masters of the system of warp-tunnels known as the Webway and roam at will from place to place. They are seen as the keepers of the ancient Eldar myths, and perform complex dances and plays to recreate these allegorical tales, covering such events as the War in Heaven, the Fall and the Birth of the Great Enemy.<br>
>The Harlequins are held by other Eldar with a mixture of fear, awe and respect. Their knowledge of the Webway is unmatched, and they can appear and disappear almost at will; at an Exodite Maiden World, in the dark city of Comorroagh or on a Craftworld. The Harlequins have even been known to appear unexpectedly alongside the forces of other races, particularly if they are fighting against the hosts of Chaos, the sworn foes of the harlequins. The Harlequins see themselves as the saviours of the Eldar, a uniting force which will one day bring together the fragmented race so that they can regain their position as the most powerful force in the galaxy. They have a great plan, unknown to all but themselves and a privaleged few, which is both far reaching and horrifying.<br>
>The Harlequins' superb acrobatic skills make them highly accomplished close combat fighters, and they are aided by arcane items of technology, such as the anti-grav flip belts and many specialist hand-to-hand weapons. Like all Eldar they are elusive foes, prefering to use swiftness and devastating attacks rather than massed armour and brute force.  <br>

>WHY COLLECT HARLEQUINS <br>
>Like other Eldar armies, the Harlequins are for the connoisseur gamer. They have many special rules to remember; complex wargear, abilities and psychic powers which must be used to best advantage for victory. They require subtle tactics on the battlefield - gamers who prefer a straight stand-up-and-fight army would do better with Space Marines or Imperial Guard! Painting a Harlequins army also requires a reasonable degree of skill. However, Harlequin armies are relatively small in terms of the number of models needed, so painting an army is not so much of an endeavour as it would first appear.<br>
>All of these things mean that the Harlequins are a great second force to collect, after you have collected a more 'mainstream' army such as Space Marines, Tyranids or Chaos. They are quite unlike any other army in the Warhammer 40,000 game and as such make an interesting choice for those of you looking for a new gaming challenge to overcome. Most tempting of all is the fact that there is probably no sight more spectacular than a well-painted Harlequin army dashing across the battlefield, tearing apart its enemies with ruthless efficiency!  <br>

>HARLEQUIN SPECIAL RULES <br>
>Holo suit: Rather than physical armour designed to absorb shots and blows, the Harlequins rely on a sophisticated holo-suit to misdirect the enemy. In game terms this means that the Harlequins have no armour save as such, but always count as if they were in cover with a 4+ save. They get no additional benefit if they really are in cover and weapons which normally ignore cover will ignore their special save. This also applies in close combat and so they always gain the benefits of a defended obstacle unless assaulted by an enemy with grenades which negate cover. As it is a cover save the Harlequins receive no normal armour save in close combat.<br>
>Models fighting a Harlequin in close combat can become confused and disorientated by the ever-shifting colours and patterns of a holo-suit. Any model fighting a Harlequin halves their Weapon Skill (rounding up). <br>
>Flip Belts: The Harlequins can ignore difficult terrain - treat difficult terrain as open ground for the purposes of movement. When advancing after winning an assault, the Harlequins can move 3D6 inches instead of 2D6 inches. In addition, a Harlequin model may use their full number of Attacks and any specialist close combat weapons they have when within 2" of an enemy in an assault - this is instead of the 1 Attack with no special rules that other models have in this situation. <br>
>Mask of Fear: Any enemy unit fighting in close combat against a Harlequin reduces their Leadership by -1.<br>
>Fleet of Foot: Instead of shooting in the shooting phase, a Harlequin unit may run instead. The unit moves D6", which is not modified by difficult terrain. <br>
>Dispersed Formation: Harlequins fight almost as individuals, and rely less upon the coherency of their unit to defeat the enemy. A Harlequin model must stay within 4" of another model in the unit, rather 2" as is normally the case. See page 43 of the Warhammer 40,000 book for details of unit coherency. <br>

>HARLEQUIN WARGEAR RULES <br>
>Note: The Harlequins can carry several different types of grenades that are used when they charge into an assault (hallucinogen, tanglefoot and plasma). A unit may only use one of these grenade types at a time, and you must declare which you are using before moving the charging unit. Note that if two or more Harlequin units charge the same enemy, they may use different grenade types (a rather devastating tactic if you can manage it!) <br>
>It is possible for a Harlequin to combine the effects of several different masks (the Mask of Fear, Dread Mask and Rictus Mask). Having more than one mask type means that the character's mask is programmed to cycle through a wider range of images, each of which is designed to illicit a different type of horror from the enemy! <br>
>Bio-explosive ammunition These specially modified shurikens contain a potent venom which overloads the target's circulatory system, causing blood vessels to violently erupt. Bio-explosive ammunition may only be used with a shuriken pistol. The weapon does not have a Strength as such, and always wounds a victim on a D6 roll of 2+. Targets slain by the bio-explosive ammunition explode! Place a blast marker centred on the exploding model and roll to hit other models under the template using the rules for blast weapons. The attacks have a Strength equal to the exploding model's Toughness, and an AP value equal to the victim's saving throw (i.e. models hit by an exploding Space Marine would take a S4 hit with AP 3). Any squad which suffers a casualty from a bio-explosive ammunition must pass a morale check at the end of the shooting phase.  <br>
>Brightlance The brightlance is used by the Eldar to destroy heavily armoured targets, using a highly focused beam of laser energy. A brightlance has the profile below. In addition, a brightlance treats any armour value higher than 12 as 12.  <br>
>D-field A domino field, or D-field as it is commonly known, creates an even more complex distortion pattern than a normal Harelquin holo-suit, shattering the wearer's image into a cloud of blindingly bright shards of multi-coloured light. A model wearing a D-field gets a 4+ cover save, just like a holo-suit. In addition, any enemy attacking the model in close combat always needs a roll of a six to hit, regardless of the models' comparative weapon skills.  <br>
>Dread mask The Dread mask contains a psychic pickup which detects the worst fears of the wearer's opponent and amplifies them ten-fold, sending them running in terror. Any unit losing an assault against a Harlequin with a Dread mask must take their morale check on 1D6 more than usual (normally 3D6 instead of 2D6). Obviously the Dread mask has no effect against units which do not have to take morale checks.  <br>
>Eldar Jetbike The Jetbikes of the Eldar are designed for extreme manoeuvrability, able to turn on the spot and rapidly accelerate or decelerate. This enables the rider to make swift hit-and-run attacks, emerging from cover to attack before slipping away again. An Eldar jetbike uses all the rules for jetbikes given in Warhammer 40,000. In addition, an unbroken model on an Eldar Jetbike may always move 6" in the assault phase, whether they are within 6" of an enemy or not. This move can be made in any direction, it does not have to be a charge towards the enemy, even if the model is within 6" of an opposing model.  <br>
>Eldar Missile Launcher The Eldar have a grasp of many forms of technology which far surpasses that of other races, and it is this knowledge that allows them to make wide use of plasma missiles. Eldar missile launchers may fire krak or plasma missiles, with the profiles given below. A squad that takes casualties from a plasma missile must test for pinning (page 58 of the Warhammer 40,000 rules).  <br>
>Fusion Gun The fusion gun is a melta-weapon, most commonly seen carried by the Fire Dragon Aspect Warriors of the Craftworld Eldar, but also found eslewhere. It has the following profile. In addition, as a melta weapon a fusion gun rolls 2D6+Strength for armour penetration when fired at half range (6"). <br>
>Hallucinogen Grenades In battle, the Harlequins use hallucinogen grenades to disorientate their enemies just before they attack. The grenades induce hallucination, paranoia and delirium in their victims, causing them to cower in fear, stare into open space or rant and rave at creatures only they can see. A Harlequin model with hallucinogen grenades uses them when it charges into combat. Any enemy model in base contact or within 2" of the Harlequin model after the Harlequins have moved must make an armour save. If they fail they may make no attacks in that assault phase.<br>
>All Tyranids and count as having 2+ armour save against hallucinogen grenades. Hallucinogen grenades have no effect against any kind of daemonic creature (including Juggernauts of Khorne, Nurglings, Avatars) Wraithlords, Wraithguard, Dreadnoughts, Dark Eldar Talos or Necrons.<br>
>Designer's note: Basically a creature has to be truly alive to be affected by hallucinogen grenades. Doubtless at some time in the far distant future we'll introduce some hideous monstrosity that should be immune to hallucinogen grenades, so this list is by no means totally exhaustive and I ask you to use some common sense concerning whether a model should be affected by these weapons.  <br>
>Harlequins' Kiss This vicious weapon is unique to the Harlquins. It takes the form of a sharpened tube attached to the forearm, inside which is lengths of monofilament wire. The Harlequin's Kiss is punched into the enemy and the wires are then quickly uncoiled, slicing the foe apart from the inside. A model with a Harlequins' Kiss does not have to roll to wound in close combat, just roll to hit and make armour saves. A Harlequin's Kiss cannot be used against vehicles.  <br>
>Haywire Grenades The Eldar use haywire grenades for disabling enemy vehicles. A haywire grenade sends out a powerful, short-range electromagnetic pulse which shorts out electrical wiring and disrupts the energy systems of its target. Haywire grenades may only be used against vehicles. A model attacking with a haywire grenade may only make a single attack, regardless of their Attacks. characteristic or whether they charged. If the attack hits, roll a dice to determine the effect of the haywire grenade: 1= no effect, 2-5= glancing hit, 6= penetrating hit. A haywire grenade may only be used against a Dreadnought if it has already been immobilised.  <br>
>Flight belt The flight belt contains a more powerful negative-gravity field than the Harlequins' flip belts, allowing the Harlequin to make amazingly high leaps and bounds as they dart across the battlefield. The model may move as if equipped with a jump pack.  <br>
>Neuro-disruptor A neuro-disruptor uses intricate psycho-crytalline circuitry to emit a wave of particles that disrupt the brain's neural pathways, turning the target into a drooling imbecile or killing them outright. The Neuro-disruptor uses the flame template and is fired like any other flame weapon. However, do not roll to wound as normal. The neuro-disruptor has a Strength of 8, but rather than using the targets' Toughness values, their Leadership is used. Other than this, the To Wound chart is used as normal. For example, a Leadership 9 model is wounded on a 5+. A roll of a 1 always fails to inflict a wound. Against vehicles, roll a D3 on the glancing hits table as the crew's brains are partially protected by the vehicle's armour. <br>
>Plasma grenades Rather than the crude fragmentation grenades used by other races, the Eldar employ advanced plasma grenades to stun their enemies when they charge into close combat. Plasma grenades negate the effect of cover in close combat, so that all attacks are worked out in Initiative order. <br>
>Phase field Using the Eldar's most advanced warp technology, a phase field allows the wearer to shift between realspace and the webway, 'phasing' in and out of reality. This means the wearer can make short teleportations across the battlefield. The phase field is used instead of moving normally. Nominate a direction for the model to move in. The model moves 3D6" in that direction, ignoring any intervening terrain. A model using a phase field may not use fleet of foot on the same turn, but may shoot and assault as normal.  <br>
>Powerblades Powerblades are fitted to the forearm, enabling the user to use both hands freely. A well trained warrior can use sweeping strikes with the powerblades in addition to their other weapons. A model equipped with powerblades gets +1 Attack. This can be in addition to +1 Attack for being armed with two other close combat weapons for a total of +2 Attacks. A model with powerblades ignores armour saves.  <br>
>Rictus mask The Rictus mask projects an aura of death, filling those nearby with an almost uncontrollable urge for morbid self-preservation ("we're all doomed!"). Any enemy unit within 12" and line of sight of the model with the Rictus mask must take a Leadership test at the start of their turn. If the test is failed the unit may do nothing that turn. <br>
>Riveblades Fitted to the back of the hand or worn as a glove, Riveblades are covered in a shimmering energy field which can punch through the thickest armour. In the hands of a Harlequin a set of Riveblades can be used to behead or disembowell the target with a single sweep. Riveblades are used in an assault. Models hit by a Harlequin with Riveblades may not take a saving throw. There is an additional effect against target's with multiple wounds. If such a model is wounded with a roll of a 6 the Riveblades have penetrated deep into their body and they are killed outright (unless the model has an invulnerable saving throw which is passed).  <br>
>Shrieker Cannon The Shrieker Cannon is similar in design to the shuriken cannon used by the Craftworld Eldar. However, rather than firing a hail of razor-sharp discs, a Shrieker fires only a single shot. Its ammunition is impregnated with virulent toxins which overload the victim's nervous system, causing their blood vessels and internal organs to burst in a spectacular fashion. The shrieker cannon does not have a Strength as such, and always wounds a victim on a D6 roll of 2+. Targets slain by the shrieker cannon explode! Place a blast marker centred on the exploding model and roll to hit other models under the template using the rules for blast weapons. The attacks have a Strength equal to the exploding model's Toughness, and an AP value equal to the victim's saving throw (i.e. models hit by an exploding Space Marine would take a S4 hit with AP 3). Any squad which suffers a casualty from a shrieker cannon must pass a morale check at the end of the shooting phase. Shrieker cannons count as having Strength 5 if fired at a vehicle. <br>
>Tanglefoot grenades When a tanglefoot grenade detonates it creates a gravitic disruption field, causing its targets to stumble, fall over and generally stagger around. Tanglefoot grenades are used when the unit charges into an assault and their effects last for the duration of that first round of combat. If the unit attacked by tanglefoot grenades loses the combat and fails its morale check, its fall back move is D6 less than normal (ie units that normally fall back 2D6" only fall back 1D6"). If the Harlequins break then their enemy may only consolidate, they may not advance. In the event of a drawn combat (on a tie-breaker roll or because neither side fails its morale check) then the unit fighting the Harlequins may not move any models into the combat - the Harlequins can move up to 6" to get into base contact as normal. See page 69 of Warhammer 40,000 for more details of drawn combats. <br>
> <br>
>HARLEQUIN MASQUE RULES <br>
>The extravagant performances of the Harlequins are known as masques. These masques have been perfected over the millennia and are carefully choreographed so that every performer is in exactly the correct place at the right time. Many of the masques involve dangerous feats of acrobatics and if a mistake were to be made it could lead to the serious injury, or even death, of one or more of the performers. The Harlequins apply this ritual to the battlefield too, utilising several war masques, which are highly evolved battle-plans. As noted in the Armoury section, you can pay points to have the Great Harlequin leading the force to have knowledge of one of the following masques. <br>
>Masque of the Dark Veil The Great Harlequin uses his or her intimate knowledge of the webway to open a portal at a strategic location on the battlefield, allowing the Harlequins to leap upon their unsuspecting foes or snatch a vital objective before the enemy can reach it. The entire Harlequin army starts the battle in reserve. However, you may roll for units to turn up from the start of the first turn rather than the second turn, as shown on the following chart:<br>
>Turn: 1 2 3+ <br>
>D6 score to arrive: 4+ 3+ 2+ <br>
>Before you roll to see which units turn up the first turn, you must nominate a point on the battlefield to be the webway exit (mark it with a counter or coin if you like). Any units which turn up from reserve must move on from that point, rather than moving on from a table edge. You may move the webway exit by 2D6" at the start of each subsequent Harlequin turn (before rolling to see which units arrive).  <br>
>Masque of the Last Laugh The Great Harlequin has trained his or her warriors to lash out at their enemies in their death throes, ensuring that they do not die alone. When a Harlequin is killed in an assault they may immediately make one attack against the model that killed them, resolved using the normal rules. The Harlequin can only ever make one attacks, regardless of how many they could normally make, and may make this attack even if thay have already attacked that turn. Once the attack has been resolved the Harlequin model is removed as normal.  <br>
>Masque of the Laughing God It is claimed that the patron of the Harlequins, the Laughing God, saves their souls from Chaos. When the Harlequins perform the Masque of the Laughing God, they call upon him to aid them against the daemons and warriors of the False God of Chaos. Through their ritual dances, they create protective auras of energy around themselves, disrupting the magicks that bind daemons to the real world. The Masque of the Laughing God means that a Chaos player who is summoning daemons to the battlefield cannot place any part of the template within 6" of a Harlequin model (before rolling the scatter dice). See Warhammer 40,000 or Codex: Chaos for more details of summoning daemons. The Masque of the Laughing God has no effect against Greater Daemons possessing models (see Codex: Chaos).  <br>
>Masque of the Red Death The Harlequins converge on a single point, taking it in turns to leap upon the enemy before withdrawing and allowing another troupe to attack. A Harlequin unit can choose to withdraw from an assault at the end of any assault phase (after all results have been worked out and any morale checks have been taken). The unit simply moves 2D6" away from the enemy unit (halved if the unit moves through difficult terrain). This move cannot be used to take the Harlequin unit into a fresh enemy. The enemy unit that the Harlequins have withdrawn from may make a consolidate move. This tactic is most effective when your units work in pairs; one unit charging, and then withdrawing from the fight in the opponent's assault phase, allowing the other unit to shoot and charge the enemy in your next turn.  <br>
>Masque of the Shifting Shadows The Harlequins dance and weave around each other, creating an ever-shifting miasma of colour. This serves to further confuse and entrance the enemy and makes it impossible to discern exactly how many warriors are attacking. When working out if one side outnumbers the other after an assault, the ratio of models is shifted one 'grade' in favour of the Harlequins.Morale checks are taken using the modified ratio by the losers of the assault. <br>

&gt;Ciao Takur  
&gt;&gt;The Harlequins are a strange sub-sect of the Eldar race, consisting of warriors from the Dark Eldar, Exodites and Craftworld Eldar. They are masters of the system of warp-tunnels known as the Webway and roam at will from place to place. They are seen as the keepers of the ancient Eldar myths, and perform complex dances and plays to recreate these allegorical tales, covering such events as the War in Heaven, the Fall and the Birth of the Great Enemy.
&gt;&gt;The Harlequins are held by other Eldar with a mixture of fear, awe and respect.

&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;WHY COLLECT HARLEQUINS 
&gt;&gt;Like other Eldar armies, the Harlequins are for the connoisseur gamer. They have many special rules to remember; complex wargear, abilities and psychic powers which must be used to best advantage for victory. They require subtle tactics on the battlefield - gamers who prefer a straight stand-up-and-fight army would do better with Space Marines or Imperial Guard! Painting a Harlequins army also requires a reasonable degree of skill. However, Harlequin armies are relatively small in terms of the number of models needed, so painting an army is not so much of an endeavour as it would first appear.
&gt;&gt;All of these things mean that the Harlequins are a great second force to collect, after you have collected a more 'mainstream' army such as Space Marines, Tyranids or Chaos.

&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;HARLEQUIN SPECIAL RULES 
&gt;&gt;Holo suit: Rather than physical armour designed to absorb shots and blows, the Harlequins rely on a sophisticated holo-suit to misdirect the enemy. In game terms this means that the Harlequins have no armour save as such, but always count as if they were in cover with a 4+ save. They get no additional benefit if they really are in cover and weapons which normally ignore cover will ignore their special save. This also applies in close combat and so they always gain the benefits of a defended obstacle unless assaulted by an enemy with grenades which negate cover. As it is a cover save the Harlequins receive no normal armour save in close combat.
&gt;&gt;Models fighting a Harlequin in close combat can become confused and disorientated by the ever-shifting colours and patterns of a holo-suit. Any model fighting a Harlequin halves their Weapon Skill (rounding up). 
&gt;&gt;Flip Belts: The Harlequins can ignore difficult terrain - treat difficult terrain as open ground for the purposes of movement.

&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;HARLEQUIN WARGEAR RULES 
&gt;&gt;Note: The Harlequins can carry several different types of grenades that are used when they charge into an assault (hallucinogen, tanglefoot and plasma). A unit may only use one of these grenade types at a time, and you must declare which you are using before moving the charging unit. Note that if two or more Harlequin units charge the same enemy, they may use different grenade types (a rather devastating tactic if you can manage it!) 
&gt;&gt;It is possible for a Harlequin to combine the effects of several different masks (the Mask of Fear, Dread Mask and Rictus Mask). Having more than one mask type means that the character's mask is programmed to cycle through a wider range of images, each of which is designed to illicit a different type of horror from the enemy! 
&gt;&gt;Bio-explosive ammunition These specially modified shurikens contain a potent venom which overloads the target's circulatory system, causing blood vessels to violently erupt. Bio-explosive ammunition may only be used with a shuriken pistol. The weapon does not have a Strength as such, and always wounds a victim on a D6 roll of 2+. Targets slain by the bio-explosive ammunition explode! Place a blast marker centred on the exploding model and roll to hit other models under the template using the rules for blast weapons. The attacks have a Strength equal to the exploding model's Toughness, and an AP value equal to the victim's saving throw (i.e. models hit by an exploding Space Marine would take a S4 hit with AP 3). Any squad which suffers a casualty from a bio-explosive ammunition must pass a morale check at the end of the shooting phase.  
&gt;&gt;Brightlance The brightlance is used by the Eldar to destroy heavily armoured targets, using a highly focused beam of laser energy. A brightlance has the profile below. In addition, a brightlance treats any armour value higher than 12 as 12.  
&gt;&gt;D-field A domino field, or D-field as it is commonly known, creates an even more complex distortion pattern than a normal Harelquin holo-suit, shattering the wearer's image into a cloud of blindingly bright shards of multi-coloured light. A model wearing a D-field gets a 4+ cover save, just like a holo-suit. In addition, any enemy attacking the model in close combat always needs a roll of a six to hit, regardless of the models' comparative weapon skills.  
&gt;&gt;Dread mask The Dread mask contains a psychic pickup which detects the worst fears of the wearer's opponent and amplifies them ten-fold, sending them running in terror. Any unit losing an assault against a Harlequin with a Dread mask must take their morale check on 1D6 more than usual (normally 3D6 instead of 2D6). Obviously the Dread mask has no effect against units which do not have to take morale checks.  
&gt;&gt;Eldar Jetbike The Jetbikes of the Eldar are designed for extreme manoeuvrability, able to turn on the spot and rapidly accelerate or decelerate. This enables the rider to make swift hit-and-run attacks, emerging from cover to attack before slipping away again. An Eldar jetbike uses all the rules for jetbikes given in Warhammer 40,000. In addition, an unbroken model on an Eldar Jetbike may always move 6&quot; in the assault phase, whether they are within 6&quot; of an enemy or not. This move can be made in any direction, it does not have to be a charge towards the enemy, even if the model is within 6&quot; of an opposing model.  
&gt;&gt;Eldar Missile Launcher The Eldar have a grasp of many forms of technology which far surpasses that of other races, and it is this knowledge that allows them to make wide use of plasma missiles. Eldar missile launchers may fire krak or plasma missiles, with the profiles given below. A squad that takes casualties from a plasma missile must test for pinning (page 58 of the Warhammer 40,000 rules).  
&gt;&gt;Fusion Gun The fusion gun is a melta-weapon, most commonly seen carried by the Fire Dragon Aspect Warriors of the Craftworld Eldar, but also found eslewhere. It has the following profile. In addition, as a melta weapon a fusion gun rolls 2D6+Strength for armour penetration when fired at half range (6&quot;). 
&gt;&gt;Hallucinogen Grenades In battle, the Harlequins use hallucinogen grenades to disorientate their enemies just before they attack. The grenades induce hallucination, paranoia and delirium in their victims, causing them to cower in fear, stare into open space or rant and rave at creatures only they can see. A Harlequin model with hallucinogen grenades uses them when it charges into combat. Any enemy model in base contact or within 2&quot; of the Harlequin model after the Harlequins have moved must make an armour save. If they fail they may make no attacks in that assault phase.
&gt;&gt;All Tyranids and count as having 2+ armour save against hallucinogen grenades. Hallucinogen grenades have no effect against any kind of daemonic creature (including Juggernauts of Khorne, Nurglings, Avatars) Wraithlords, Wraithguard, Dreadnoughts, Dark Eldar Talos or Necrons.
&gt;&gt;Designer's note: Basically a creature has to be truly alive to be affected by hallucinogen grenades. Doubtless at some time in the far distant future we'll introduce some hideous monstrosity that should be immune to hallucinogen grenades, so this list is by no means totally exhaustive and I ask you to use some common sense concerning whether a model should be affected by these weapons.  
&gt;&gt;Harlequins' Kiss This vicious weapon is unique to the Harlquins. It takes the form of a sharpened tube attached to the forearm, inside which is lengths of monofilament wire. The Harlequin's Kiss is punched into the enemy and the wires are then quickly uncoiled, slicing the foe apart from the inside. A model with a Harlequins' Kiss does not have to roll to wound in close combat, just roll to hit and make armour saves. A Harlequin's Kiss cannot be used against vehicles.  
&gt;&gt;Haywire Grenades The Eldar use haywire grenades for disabling enemy vehicles. A haywire grenade sends out a powerful, short-range electromagnetic pulse which shorts out electrical wiring and disrupts the energy systems of its target. Haywire grenades may only be used against vehicles. A model attacking with a haywire grenade may only make a single attack, regardless of their Attacks. characteristic or whether they charged. If the attack hits, roll a dice to determine the effect of the haywire grenade: 1= no effect, 2-5= glancing hit, 6= penetrating hit. A haywire grenade may only be used against a Dreadnought if it has already been immobilised.  
&gt;&gt;Flight belt The flight belt contains a more powerful negative-gravity field than the Harlequins' flip belts, allowing the Harlequin to make amazingly high leaps and bounds as they dart across the battlefield. The model may move as if equipped with a jump pack.  
&gt;&gt;Neuro-disruptor A neuro-disruptor uses intricate psycho-crytalline circuitry to emit a wave of particles that disrupt the brain's neural pathways, turning the target into a drooling imbecile or killing them outright. The Neuro-disruptor uses the flame template and is fired like any other flame weapon. However, do not roll to wound as normal. The neuro-disruptor has a Strength of 8, but rather than using the targets' Toughness values, their Leadership is used. Other than this, the To Wound chart is used as normal. For example, a Leadership 9 model is wounded on a 5+. A roll of a 1 always fails to inflict a wound. Against vehicles, roll a D3 on the glancing hits table as the crew's brains are partially protected by the vehicle's armour. 
&gt;&gt;Plasma grenades Rather than the crude fragmentation grenades used by other races, the Eldar employ advanced plasma grenades to stun their enemies when they charge into close combat. Plasma grenades negate the effect of cover in close combat, so that all attacks are worked out in Initiative order. 
&gt;&gt;Phase field Using the Eldar's most advanced warp technology, a phase field allows the wearer to shift between realspace and the webway, 'phasing' in and out of reality. This means the wearer can make short teleportations across the battlefield. The phase field is used instead of moving normally. Nominate a direction for the model to move in. The model moves 3D6&quot; in that direction, ignoring any intervening terrain. A model using a phase field may not use fleet of foot on the same turn, but may shoot and assault as normal.  
&gt;&gt;Powerblades Powerblades are fitted to the forearm, enabling the user to use both hands freely. A well trained warrior can use sweeping strikes with the powerblades in addition to their other weapons. A model equipped with powerblades gets +1 Attack. This can be in addition to +1 Attack for being armed with two other close combat weapons for a total of +2 Attacks. A model with powerblades ignores armour saves.  
&gt;&gt;Rictus mask The Rictus mask projects an aura of death, filling those nearby with an almost uncontrollable urge for morbid self-preservation (&quot;we're all doomed!&quot;). Any enemy unit within 12&quot; and line of sight of the model with the Rictus mask must take a Leadership test at the start of their turn. If the test is failed the unit may do nothing that turn. 
&gt;&gt;Riveblades Fitted to the back of the hand or worn as a glove, Riveblades are covered in a shimmering energy field which can punch through the thickest armour. In the hands of a Harlequin a set of Riveblades can be used to behead or disembowell the target with a single sweep. Riveblades are used in an assault. Models hit by a Harlequin with Riveblades may not take a saving throw. There is an additional effect against target's with multiple wounds. If such a model is wounded with a roll of a 6 the Riveblades have penetrated deep into their body and they are killed outright (unless the model has an invulnerable saving throw which is passed).  
&gt;&gt;Shrieker Cannon The Shrieker Cannon is similar in design to the shuriken cannon used by the Craftworld Eldar. However, rather than firing a hail of razor-sharp discs, a Shrieker fires only a single shot. Its ammunition is impregnated with virulent toxins which overload the victim's nervous system, causing their blood vessels and internal organs to burst in a spectacular fashion. The shrieker cannon does not have a Strength as such, and always wounds a victim on a D6 roll of 2+. Targets slain by the shrieker cannon explode! Place a blast marker centred on the exploding model and roll to hit other models under the template using the rules for blast weapons. The attacks have a Strength equal to the exploding model's Toughness, and an AP value equal to the victim's saving throw (i.e. models hit by an exploding Space Marine would take a S4 hit with AP 3). Any squad which suffers a casualty from a shrieker cannon must pass a morale check at the end of the shooting phase. Shrieker cannons count as having Strength 5 if fired at a vehicle. 
&gt;&gt;Tanglefoot grenades When a tanglefoot grenade detonates it creates a gravitic disruption field, causing its targets to stumble, fall over and generally stagger around. Tanglefoot grenades are used when the unit charges into an assault and their effects last for the duration of that first round of combat. If the unit attacked by tanglefoot grenades loses the combat and fails its morale check, its fall back move is D6 less than normal (ie units that normally fall back 2D6&quot; only fall back 1D6&quot;). If the Harlequins break then their enemy may only consolidate, they may not advance. In the event of a drawn combat (on a tie-breaker roll or because neither side fails its morale check) then the unit fighting the Harlequins may not move any models into the combat - the Harlequins can move up to 6&quot; to get into base contact as normal. See page 69 of Warhammer 40,000 for more details of drawn combats. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;HARLEQUIN MASQUE RULES 
&gt;&gt;The extravagant performances of the Harlequins are known as masques. These masques have been perfected over the millennia and are carefully choreographed so that every performer is in exactly the correct place at the right time. Many of the masques involve dangerous feats of acrobatics and if a mistake were to be made it could lead to the serious injury, or even death, of one or more of the performers. The Harlequins apply this ritual to the battlefield too, utilising several war masques, which are highly evolved battle-plans. As noted in the Armoury section, you can pay points to have the Great Harlequin leading the force to have knowledge of one of the following masques. 
&gt;&gt;Masque of the Dark Veil The Great Harlequin uses his or her intimate knowledge of the webway to open a portal at a strategic location on the battlefield, allowing the Harlequins to leap upon their unsuspecting foes or snatch a vital objective before the enemy can reach it. The entire Harlequin army starts the battle in reserve. However, you may roll for units to turn up from the start of the first turn rather than the second turn, as shown on the following chart:
&gt;&gt;Turn: 1 2 3+ 
&gt;&gt;D6 score to arrive: 4+ 3+ 2+ 
&gt;&gt;Before you roll to see which units turn up the first turn, you must nominate a point on the battlefield to be the webway exit (mark it with a counter or coin if you like). Any units which turn up from reserve must move on from that point, rather than moving on from a table edge. You may move the webway exit by 2D6&quot; at the start of each subsequent Harlequin turn (before rolling to see which units arrive).  
&gt;&gt;Masque of the Last Laugh The Great Harlequin has trained his or her warriors to lash out at their enemies in their death throes, ensuring that they do not die alone. When a Harlequin is killed in an assault they may immediately make one attack against the model that killed them, resolved using the normal rules. The Harlequin can only ever make one attacks, regardless of how many they could normally make, and may make this attack even if thay have already attacked that turn. Once the attack has been resolved the Harlequin model is removed as normal.  
&gt;&gt;Masque of the Laughing God It is claimed that the patron of the Harlequins, the Laughing God, saves their souls from Chaos. When the Harlequins perform the Masque of the Laughing God, they call upon him to aid them against the daemons and warriors of the False God of Chaos. Through their ritual dances, they create protective auras of energy around themselves, disrupting the magicks that bind daemons to the real world. The Masque of the Laughing God means that a Chaos player who is summoning daemons to the battlefield cannot place any part of the template within 6&quot; of a Harlequin model (before rolling the scatter dice). See Warhammer 40,000 or Codex: Chaos for more details of summoning daemons. The Masque of the Laughing God has no effect against Greater Daemons possessing models (see Codex: Chaos).  
&gt;&gt;Masque of the Red Death The Harlequins converge on a single point, taking it in turns to leap upon the enemy before withdrawing and allowing another troupe to attack. A Harlequin unit can choose to withdraw from an assault at the end of any assault phase (after all results have been worked out and any morale checks have been taken). The unit simply moves 2D6&quot; away from the enemy unit (halved if the unit moves through difficult terrain). This move cannot be used to take the Harlequin unit into a fresh enemy. The enemy unit that the Harlequins have withdrawn from may make a consolidate move. This tactic is most effective when your units work in pairs; one unit charging, and then withdrawing from the fight in the opponent's assault phase, allowing the other unit to shoot and charge the enemy in your next turn.  
&gt;&gt;Masque of the Shifting Shadows The Harlequins dance and weave around each other, creating an ever-shifting miasma of colour. This serves to further confuse and entrance the enemy and makes it impossible to discern exactly how many warriors are attacking. When working out if one side outnumbers the other after an assault, the ratio of models is shifted one 'grade' in favour of the Harlequins.Morale checks are taken using the modified ratio by the losers of the assault.
