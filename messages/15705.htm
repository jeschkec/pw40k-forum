*wieder da*<p>
<br>
Adeptus Arbites									<br>
We Are The Law!<p>
<br>
Da Background<br>
This list is designed to replace the existing Adeptus Arbites list from Citadel Journal 29.  The goal is to add some new forces, weapons, and vehicles to make it a more playable and challenging army.   It also assumes you know something about the Adeptus Arbites, as I haven’t written any fluff up yet.  It will get added though, not to worry!  <p>
For now though, all you need to know that the Arbites are the planetary Imperial Police force.  They are independent of the planet’s Governor, reporting directly to the Adeptus Terra.  Indeed, one of their primary functions is to keep a careful watch on the planetary rulers for signs of treasonous activities!  They are not really there for actual armed combat or to fight wars, but more for maintaining order, suppressing uprisings, crushing any criminal or revolutionary activities, and generally keeping the populace in line.  As such, most of their weapons are not lethal but more aimed at crowd control.  They have limited heavy firepower to deal with armed insurrectionists, but for heavy opposition or actual alien invasions their main job is to hold out as long as possible and call for aid.   <p>
<p>
Da Rules<p>
Rulebook/Codex Updates<br>
You may choose the following from the Heroes of the Imperium section of the 40K Rulebook to join your Arbites force: Inquisitor, Missionary, Confessor (all count as HQ selections).  A Preacher may be chosen to lead an Arbites Patrol Team; if chosen though the unit cannot upgrade to a Proctor though.<br>
One Assassin may be chosen as per Codex: Assassins for an Arbites force.<p>
One Judge chosen from the list below may be added to a Imperial Guard or Sisters of Battle army as an HQ choice.   A Marshall may be included as a unit leader in the same manner as a Preacher.   <p>
One Patrol Team may be included as a Troops force selection choice in any Space Marine (except Dark Angels), Imperial Guard, or Sisters of Battle force (or any other forces of the Imperium that additionally be created), unless specifically stated otherwise.<p>
<br>
Special Rules<br>
Arbite forces have a Strategy Rating of 1D6 (but may re-roll their first roll), and a Vehicle Leadership Value of 7 for campaign use.   For Missions involving Sentries, use ten Patrol Team Arbitrators (Initiative 3).<p>
Call for Backup!<br>
Depending on the size of the enemy they face, a beleaguered Arbite precinct will often call on reinforcements.  Only one unit of reinforcements can be taken and can use any unit options it would have normally.  Each starts the game in Reserve, even if the mission does not use that special rule.   They will enter play from the Arbites side of the board (or a random board side if the Arbites did not start from a side).<p>
Reinforcements do not count towards your normal force selections, but any points spent on reinforcements do count towards your army points value.<p>
Enemy Size:	Reinforcements:<br>
0-1500		Nothing to see here, go about your business!    No reinforcements allowed<br>
1501-2000	Just a minor disturbance!  One Imperial Guard Infantry squad or one Hive Gang Militia unit*<br>
2001-2500	For Church & State!  One Battle Sisters Squad or any other options for lower points forces<br>
2501 and higher	Call out the Marines!  One Space Marine Tactical Squad** or any other options for lower points forces<br>
* See Codex: Armageddon for details<br>
** Or the equivalent depending on the Chapter (Grey Hunters for Space Wolves, Battle Squad for Black Templars, etc) <p>
<br>
The Thin Blue Line<br>
Arbite forces are commonly the final line of defense on many Imperial planets, knowing that they must hold on until off-planet forces can arrive.  They also command valuable munitions and communications equipment, which enemy forces are eager to capture as quickly as possible.   <br>
An Adeptus Arbites force may always choose to be Defender in any missions where Attacker and Defender designations are used.<p>
<br>
Precinct Defenses<br>
In any missions allowing the Arbites force to use Fortifications, the player may choose Turret Emplacements using the rules from the Imperial Armor book with the following changes:<br>
Crew will be 3 Arbitrators armed with Arbite Shotguns<br>
Each Turret Emplacement counts as a Heavy Support option<br>
Only weapons costing 50 points or less can be used<br>
Heavy Webbers (+20 points) and Water Cannons (+10 points) are also weapon options<p>
<p>
Weapons & Wargear<br>
Arbite Characters can requisition weapons and wargear as per the Armoury list in Codex: Imperial Guard.  Only Judges and Marshalls may choose as Officers and Commissars, and a Judge counts as a Colonel for wargear selection options.  All Arbites characters may also choose from the Arbites Armoury list below:<p>
Weapons:<br>
Suppression Shield: Gives user +2 to their Armor Save in Close Combat (this cannot take their Armor Save to better than a 2+ however).  Although a Suppression Shield is not a Weapon as such, it counts as a single-handed weapon because nothing else can be used by the arm carrying the shield.  <br>
6 points<p>
Shock Maul: Counts as a Single-handed Close Combat Weapon.<br>
1 point<p>
Arbites Shotgun: This can fire a regular shotgun shell or special Executioner rounds (R18”, S4, AP5, Assault 1).  Executioner shots may re-roll a miss (just as if it was a linked weapon).  Like a regular Shotgun, it counts as a two-handed weapon.<br>
3 points.<p>
Shock Shield: same as Suppression Shield, but also each round one enemy in contact (chosen by the Arbite player) with it at start close combat must make their regular saving throw (armor or any other type they may have).  If they fail, they must strike at -1 Initiative in that combat.  <br>
10 points.<p>
Power Maul: Counts as a Single-handed Power Weapon, but only  negates armor saves in the first round of a combat as it needs time to recharge between use.  After that it counts as a regular Close Combat Weapon for the remainder of that combat.<br>
7 points.<p>
Wargear:<br>
Book of Law: Judge or Marshall only.  All Arbite units within 6” of the model may always test to Regroup, even if below 50% Strength or within 6” of the enemy.<br>
15 points.<p>
Arbites Bike: Independent Characters only.  Can only be taken if the rest of the unit is allowed to take a bike as well.  Functions exactly as a regular Space Marine bike, but is armed with a twin-linked Autogun.  This may be upgraded to a twin-linked Boltgun for +10 points.<br>
25 points.<p>
Power Armor: Each precinct usually has a few precious suits of this highly valued armor for their higher ranking officers.  Power Armor gives the user an Armor Save of 3+, and cannot be taken by models on horseback due to the weight.<br>
15 points<p>
<br>
New Weapon Options<br>
Arbite Grenade Launchers can fire Frag and Krak rounds as normal, plus two new rounds designed specifically for Riot/Crowd Control.  They may only effect living creatures, so Vehicles, Demons, Necrons, Thousand Sons, Avatars, Wraithguard, etc. are not effected.<p>
Take-Down: This releases a concentrated mix incapacitating gases designed to seep into skin and irritate eyes.  When the round explodes it also sends out broadband ultrasonics to effect hearing and disorientate the enemy.  <br>
S3, AP-, Blast marker.  If casualties occur no-one dies but the unit is Pinned as they become incapacitated; units immune to Pinning are unaffected.  Open-topped vehicles are effected on a D6 roll of 1 with a D3 result on the Glancing Hit table.<p>
Sunburst:  When it detonates this round ignites like a small star, blinding any models nearby as well as blistering exposed skin.  The intense multi-spectral light is enough to usually overload any vision protection systems.<br>
S-, AP-, Blast marker. All models touching template must make their saving throw (Armor, Cover, Invulnerable, or any others they might have) or the unit must take a test for Pinning.  Units immune to Pinning are unaffected. Open-topped vehicles are effected on a D6 roll of 1 with a Crew Shaken result.<br>
 <p>
<br>
New Vehicle Upgrades:<br>
Riot Plow: Special plow mounting is affixed to the tank, with sloped blades designed to push crowds away from the tank.  Any model attempting to perform a Death or Glory attack against the tank must first roll equal to or under their Initiative (a roll of 1 automatically fails).  If they fail, they cannot do the attack but are otherwise unharmed; move the models to the side of the tank.  If they pass, they can conduct their attack as normal.  Note you must declare all models attempting the Death or Glory attack before making any Initiative checks.  A Riot Plow also acts as a Rough Terrain Modification, so not much point taking both of them <g>.<br>
15 points.<p>
<br>
New Vehicle Weaponry:<br>
Heavy Webber:  Crowd control device that sprays out a sticky liquid that forms solid webbing on contact with the air.   More fluff later – for now, think Spiderman.<p>
To fire, place the flamer template as normal; all models touched are hit automatically and cover ignored. Each must roll a D6 and add that to its Strength.  They may add any special close combat effects such as Power Fists, and having a Power Weapon allows them to add +1 to their Strength. Big Gunz/Support Weapons that are hit count as having a Strength of 5.  On a result of 8 or higher, the model has broken free and suffers no effects.  If the score is 7 or less, or the D6 roll was a 1, the model suffers one wound (normal Armor or Invulnerable saves allowed).  Units that take any casualties must test for Pinning as they struggle to get out of the webbing, even if immune from Pinning (use a Ld 10 if the unit has no Ld value).   Big Gunz/Support Weapons that fail their roll cannot fire in the following turn.<p>
A unit that was previously Pinned by a Heavy Webber is even more likely to fall victim to its effects, and must take their Pinning test with a -1 modifier for each consecutive turn spent Pinned.   A unit Pinned due to webbing fights at a -1 Initiative in an Assault’s first round.<p>
Vehicles can also be effected by the tangling webs.  Roll 2D6, adding a further D6 if the vehicle did not move in the previous turn, and total the sum.   If the score equals or beats the Armor Value, the vehicle must take an immediate Difficult Terrain Test.  Skimmers effected instead take a D3 roll on the Glancing Hit table.  Walkers and any other vehicles with a WS test as per regular Models above, but if they fail they must take the Difficult Terrain Test like a normal vehicle next turn.<p>
Water Cannon: Standard crowd control device, cheap and ideal for non-lethal crowd dispersal.  <br>
R12”, S4, AP6, Heavy 3<br>
Any model “wounded” is actually knocked to his feet, and the unit must take a Pinning test even if immune to Pinning (use a Ld 10 if the unit has no Ld value).   Open-topped vehicles that are hit are effected on a D6 roll of 1 with a D3 result on the Glancing Hit table.<p>

(0-1) Judge<br>
Profile	Points/Model	WS	BS	S	T	W	I	A	Ld	Sv<br>
Judge	45	4	4	3	3	3	4	3	10	4+<p>
Independent Character:  Unless accompanied by a Bodyguard, a Judge is an Independent Character and follows all normal rules for Independent Characters from the Warhammer 40,00 Rulebook.<p>
Options:  Judges may choose additional equipment from the Armory as normal. <p>
Special Rules: Any Arbites unit within 6” of a Judge may make all Morale and Pinning tests using his Leadership.<p>
Bodyguard:   A Judge may be accompanied by an Escort Squad; see the entry below for details.  Note that the Judge and Escort Squad count as a single HQ choice.<p>
<br>
Marshall<br>

Marshall	25	4	4	3	3	2	3	2	9	4+<p>

Options: Marshalls may choose additional equipment from the Armory as normal.<p>
Bodyguard:   A Marshall may be accompanied by an Escort Squad; see the entry below for details.  Note that the Marshall and Escort Squad count as a single HQ choice.<p>
<p>
Detective<br>
Profile	Points/Model	WS	BS	S	T	W	I	A	Ld	Sv<br>
Detective	20	3	3	3	3	1	3	1	8	4+<p>
Independent Character:  A Detective is an Independent Character and follows all normal rules for Independent Characters from the Warhammer 40,00 Rulebook.<p>
Options:  Detectives may choose additional equipment from the Armory as normal.<p>
<br>
Special Rules:  I’m experimenting with two different ones.  The first is really based no more on a desire among many players for Judge Anderson to appear in the list <g>, the second is perhaps a bit more “realistic.”  Feedback please on which you like better!<p>
Option 1: Psychic Power: Scan  This acts like a Scanner and also a Searchlight for Night Fighting missions, but with a shorter range.  The Detective takes a Psychic Test, and if he passes he can make like a Searchlight with an 18” range, or at start of game suppress any Infiltrators within 24” and force them to be repositioned.  Unlike a normal Searchlight, he doesn’t illuminate himself when using his power and thus specially cannot be targeted.  Scan can also force any enemy models concealed for any reason within 2D6” to be revealed.<p>
Option 2: Special Rules: Undercover Cop  <br>
Detectives are specially trained to infiltrate and gather intelligence on enemy actions.  They also use a wide network of informants and spies, all designed to keep the Precinct aware of any possible anti-Imperial activities or alien landings.   This helps ensure that while the Arbites may not be on the offensive in the attack, at the least they are not taken unawares.   To represent this, if the Arbite force contains a Detective then it may re-roll it’s dice roll for deciding who goes first.<p>
<br>
Escort Squad<br>
Depending on the character, one Arbite unit may be chosen as his Escort Squad.  The team chosen has all normal options, but may not upgrade a member to Proctor.<br>
Judge – Combat Team, Shock Team, or Patrol Team<br>
	Note – if his Combat Team is in Power Armor, the Judge must also take Power Armor<br>
Marshall – Rapid Pursuit Team, Patrol Team<p>
Options:  One member of an Escort Team may be upgraded to Precinct Standard Bearer for +10 points, using the rules for Standard Bearers from Codex: Imperial Guard.  He may choose either a Holy Relic or Regimental Standard, again using the rules and points values from that codex.  <br>
 Elites<p>
<br>
Arbites Shock Team<br>
Profile	Points/Model	WS	BS	S	T	W	I	A	Ld	Sv<br>
Arbitrator	12	3	3	3	3	1	3	1	7	4+<br>
Proctor	+7	3	3	3	3	1	3	2	8	4+<br>
Squad: The unit consists of between 5 and 10 Arbitrators. <p>
Weapons: Each member is armed with a Suppression Shield and Shock Maul.<p>
Options:  The entire unit may be armed with any of the following: Frag Grenades (+1 point per model), Krak Grenades (+2 points per model), Smoke/Blind Grenades (+2 points per model).<p>
Character: One Arbitrator may be upgraded to a Proctor for +7 points, and may choose additional equipment from the Armory except for special access items as noted.<p>
Transport: The unit may be transported in an Chimera or Rhino (see Transport section for details). This will not count as a further selection for the army.  <p>
<p>
Arbites Combat Team<br>

Weapons:  Each member is armed with a Boltgun.<p>
Options: Up to two models can be issued one of the following: Flamer (+8 pts), Grenade Launcher (+10 pts), Heavy Stubber (+10 points).<br>
One Combat Team per Arbites force may upgrade all members to Power Armor at +10 points per model.<p>
Character: One Arbitrator may be upgraded to a Proctor for +7 points, and may choose additional equipment from the Armory except for special access items as noted.  If leading a Combat Team in Power Armor, the Proctor must also take Power Armor.<p>
Transport: The unit may be transported in an Chimera or Rhino (see Transport section for details). This will not count as a further selection for the army.  <p>
<br>
 <br>
(0-1) Arbites Sniper Support Squad<br>
Profile	Points/Team	WS	BS	S	T	W	I	A	Ld	Sv<br>
Sniper Team	38	3	4	3	3	1	3	1	7	4+<br>
Squad: The Squad consists of 1 to 3 two-man teams.  Each team operates on its own, and counts as a separate unit for purposes of Victory Points.  Sniper teams cannot claim board quarters.<p>
Weapons:  One Arbite in each team is armed with a Sniper Rifle and Autopistol and the other with a Boltgun. <p>
Special Rules<br>
Take out the Leader! Arbite Snipers are specially trained to pick off Riot leaders or other members of importance, as this is usually the best way to quell any uprisings.  If a Sniper rolls a 6 to hit, he may apply the hit to any member of the target unit (within Line of Sight and weapon range) rather than allowing the enemy play to decide who is hit.<p>
Superior Training: Sniper Teams are supremely dedicated and specially trained to fight independently.  They never need take a Morale Test for shooting casualties, and can always attempt to Regroup if below 50% strength.  They are also immune from Last Man Standing tests.  <p>
Infiltrate:  Sniper Support Teams may set up via the Infiltrators rule, but only if the mission allows that scenario rule.  Otherwise they must set up as normal.<br>
 Troops<p>
Arbites Patrol Team<br>
Profile	Points/Model	WS	BS	S	T	W	I	A	Ld	Sv<br>
Arbitrator	11	3	3	3	3	1	3	1	7	4+<br>
Proctor	+7	3	3	3	3	1	3	2	8	4+<br>
Squad: The unit consists of between 5 and 20 Arbitrators. <p>
Weapons:  Each member is armed with an Arbites Shotgun.<p>
Options: One model may upgrade to a Grenade Launcher (+7 points) or Bolt Gun (+2 points).<p>
Character: One Arbitrator may be upgraded to a Proctor for +7 points, and may choose additional equipment from the Armory except for special access items as noted.<p>
Transport: The unit may be transported in a Rhino (see Transport section for details). This will not count as a further selection for the army.  They can fit all 20 into a Rhino, but it will count as Open-Topped while there are more than 11 models inside (the extra Arbites are riding on the running boards, 5 to a side, using side-mounted hand-holds).  Only ½ of the models can still fire though, as the extras are holding on with both hands to the rails.<p>
<p>
Penal Legion <br>
Profile	Points/Model	WS	BS	S	T	W	I	A	Ld	Sv<br>
Penal Legionnaire	5	3	2	3	3	1	3	1	5	-<br>
Warden	15	3	3	3	3	1	3	1	8	4+<br>
Squad: The unit consists of one Warden leading 10-20 scum of the galaxy, each hoping to live through the combat and possibly be rewarded with a parole.  You may not field more Penal Legion units than you have Arbite Patrol Teams in your army, and no other character will ever join the unit.<p>
Weapons: Penal Legionnaires are armed lasguns, each weapon fitted a special IFF system so that they cannot fire upon Imperial forces.  They also carry an assortment of crude close combat weapons.<p>
Character: The Penal Legion is lead by an Arbite Warden, armed with an Arbites Shotgun and the collar controls. He may choose additional equipment from the Armory except for special access items as noted.<p>
Penal Legion Collars:  <br>
Frenzon:  Once per game at any time, the Warden can activate special Frenzon chemical injectors in the collars.  This gives the rest of the unit +1 Attack and +1 Initiative for the rest of the turn.<br>
Explosive: If the unit fails any Morale or Pinning Tests (or is automatically fails such a test), the Warden may detonate one explosive collar, instantly killing one of the legionnaires.  The unit may then re-take the test, using the Warden’s base Leadership of 8.  No negative modifiers are used, due to the highly inspirational nature of the collar detonation!.  This may only be done once per test however – if they fail again, they fail.  If the Warden is killed, the unit will take a Morale test using only their own Leadership of 5.  If they pass, they fight on with newly instilled faith in their Emperor.  If they fail, the unit disperses from play as the cowards run for freedom!<p>
<p>
Arbites Cadet Team<br>
Profile	Points/Model	WS	BS	S	T	W	I	A	Ld	Sv<br>
Cadet	7	3	3	3	3	1	3	1	6	5+<br>
Proctor	15	3	3	3	3	1	3	2	8	4+<br>
Squad: The unit consists of between one Arbite Proctor and 4-9 Cadets.<p>
Weapons:  Cadets are wear Flak Armor (5+ Armor Save) and are armed with a Close Combat Weapon and Autopistol.  <p>
Options: One Cadet may be upgraded to carry a Bolt Pistol (+4 points), Boltgun (+4 points) or Arbites Shotgun (+3 points).<p>
Character: The Proctor wears Carapace Armor (4+ Armor Save) and is armed with an Arbites Shotgun.  He may choose additional equipment from the Armory except for special access items as noted.<p>
<p>

Handler	15	3	3	3	3	1	3	1	8	4+<p>
Squad: The unit consists of 5-10 Kayninez plus a Handler.  It cannot be transported.<p>
Weapons:  Teeth and claws!<p>
Character: The team is lead by an Arbite Handler, armed with an Arbites Shotgun.  He may choose additional equipment from the Armory except for special access items as noted.<p>
Special Rules: <br>
Kayninez are genetically enhanced dogs, specially bread and trained for Arbite use in crowd control.  They Move 6”, and can Assault 12” (if assaulting through Difficult Terrain, roll 2D6 and double the highest for their Assault movement).  This often means they will run ahead of their Handler to engage the enemy.  If more than 2” from their Handler, both Handler and dogs must attempt to regain unit coherency in their Movement Phase if possible.  The bloodthirsty nature of the Kayninez means they will always Pursue if their enemy Falls Back in an Assault however, unless they can restrain themselves by passing a Leadership Test.   <br>
If the Handler is killed, the pack is removed from play.  Otherwise, they can always use his Leadership, no matter how far away they are from him.<p>
<p>
<br>
Transport<br>
The Adeptus Arbites commonly use two main vehicles for transport: the Rhino (as per Codex: Space Marines) and the Chimera (as per Codex: Imperial Guard).  Note that they may only have the vehicle upgrades listed below though, and BS3 for both tanks.  Each can carry 10 Arbites plus an extra character model (11 in all), except in the case of  Patrol Team special rules for their Rhino.  Other Arbite tanks can only take the upgrades listed in their entry.<p>
Vehicle Upgrades:<br>
Arbite Chimera and Rhino vehicles may only take the following Vehicle Upgrades from Codex: Imperial Guard<br>
Extra Armor, Pintle Mounted Storm Bolter, Rough Terrain Modifications, Searchlight, Smoke Launchers.<br>
They may also both take the new vehicle upgrade Riot Plow.<br>
 Fast Attack<p>
Arbites Rapid Pursuit Team<br>

Proctor	+8	3	3	3	3	1	3	2	8	4+<br>
Squad: The unit consists of between 3 and 10 Arbitrators.   The team must all be mounted on bikes at +10 points per model or on horseback (or the local planetary equivalent) for +4 points per model.  If on bikes, they gain a +1 Toughness as normal.  Note the entire team must be mounted the same way – no mixing bikes & horses!<p>
Weapons:  Each member is armed with an Arbites Shotgun and Autopistol.   Arbite bikes are armed with a twin-linked Autogun.<p>
Options: One model may replace their Shotgun with either a Grenade Launcher for +6 points or Boltgun for +4 points.   <br>
The entire unit may be armed with Frag Grenades at +1 point per model.<br>
Arbite Bikes can be upgraded to carry a twin-linked Boltgun for +8 points per bike.<p>
Character: One Arbitrator may be upgraded to a Proctor for +8 points, and may choose additional equipment from the Armory except for special access items as noted.   Units with a Proctor normally represent the elite riders in the Precinct, and due to their superior skills may also choose to move at a Trot.  See Codex: Imperial Guard for details on this special rule.<p>

Options:  The Thunderhead may take the following vehicle upgrades from Codex: Imperial Guard:<br>
Pintle-Mounted Storm Bolter, Searchlight, Smoke Launchers, Track Guards, Extra Armor, Rough Terrain Modifications.<p>
Thunderhead Ram: This is a special reinforced Hydraulic Ram attached to front of the basic Rhino chassis, used in Riot and Crowd Control situations to destroy civilian vehicles, knock down barricades, etc.  Reinforcing mechanisms and hydraulics take up all transport capability.  If the Ram impacts an enemy vehicle, both players roll a D6 and add the Armor Value of the sides touching (the Thunderhead will always roll for Front, since that is where the Ram is located).  The Arbite player also rolls an additional D6 for each full 4” the Thunderhead moved that turn in a straight line.  If the enemy vehicle was Immobilized, or the Thunderhead is striking a fixed emplacement like a Bunker, the Arbite player may re-roll the one of the dice before picking the highest as his roll.<p>
The low scoring vehicle takes a Glancing Hit, but cannot get a result any greater than the difference between the two scores.  If a tie, both vehicles take a Crew Shaken result.  Skimmers cannot be Rammed, nor Flyers for obvious reasons (unless they are landed).   Only Immobilized Walkers can be Rammed (as otherwise they simple dodge the more cumbersome tank).  <p>
While operational, the ram adds +1 to the front Armor value.  If the Thunderhead Tank takes a Weapon Destroyed result in a Ram attempt, the weapon must be the ram; it is torn off and cannot be used again.  Otherwise the Thunderhead Ram counts as a regular weapon for damage results.<p>
<p>
(0-1) Huntsman Command and Control Vehicle <br>
Profile	Points	Front	Side	Rear	BS<br>
Huntsman	100	12	10	10	3<br>
Type: Tank, Open Topped<p>
Crew: Arbitrators.  A special 5 man squad is also carried by the Huntsman, consisting of a Marshall (armed with a Master-Crafted Shotgun) and 4 Arbitrators (3 armed with Shotguns and 1 with a Grenade Launcher).  The Marshall acts as tank commander while the Arbitrators serve as a defensive firebase. The squad can only leave the Huntsman if it is destroyed.  Otherwise they function as a normal transported squad – they can target independently of the vehicle at another target unit, and all can fire since the vehicle is Open-Topped.  Full vehicle Victory Points are only scored if all the squad members are killed as well, otherwise no more than ½ of the Huntsman’s points cost can be awarded no matter how badly it is damaged.<p>
Weapons:  A single Hull mounted and two Sponson mounted Heavy Webbers. <p>
Options:  The Huntsman may take the following vehicle upgrades from Codex: Imperial Guard:<br>
Pintle-Mounted Storm Bolter, Searchlight, Mine Sweeper, Smoke Launchers, Track Guards, Extra Armor, Rough Terrain Modifications.<br>
It may also be given the new vehicle upgrade Riot Plow.<p>
Command and Control:  The Huntsman also serves as a mobile targeting control center for the Arbite force.  It carries an array of command & control equipment, with multiple video systems displaying the gathered data for the Marshall.  He can then relay this information to fellow Arbite units.  The Huntsman counts as having the vehicle upgrade Improved Comms (see Codex: Imperial Guard for details, but note it will only effect other Adeptus Arbites units for Reserve rolling). This allows any one Arbite unit within 12” of the Huntsman to re-roll any shooting misses once per turn, as long as the Huntsman also had Line of Sight to that target (note this cannot be used if Smoke Launchers were used that turn!).<p>
Riot Control Firing Modes: All three Heavy Webbers on the Huntsman are linked to sophisticated motion detection and IFF sensors, and then networked into an onboard firing computer.  When engaged, this system automatically targets the largest enemy masses in its fire arc, without the need for human control.  Since the primary purpose is to subdue the maximum number of rioters as quickly as possible, this is the normal firing mode.  It can be disengaged for direct operator control (for more precise targeting of mob leaders, for example), but at the expense of the more rapid automatic response.  <p>
To represent this, all three Heavy Webbers count as a single weapon for determining how many weapons the vehicle can fire (and thus it can fire all three even if it moved up to 6”).  All three templates must be placed as per normal targeting rules though from the 40K Rulebook, and each must target the closest unit in its fire arc.  Alternatively, the automatic system may be disengaged and a single Heavy Webber may be singled out for direct firing.  One Heavy Webber template may be placed in any direction, not just to cover the maximum number of models as normal (it can still only target a single unit though).  The other two Heavy Webbers firing on automatic control will target as normal.  When this is done though each Heavy Webber will count as a separate weapon for firing purposes.<p>

&gt;
&gt;Adeptus Arbites									
&gt;We Are The Law!
&gt;
&gt;Da Background
&gt;This list is designed to replace the existing Adeptus Arbites list from Citadel Journal 29.  The goal is to add some new forces, weapons, and vehicles to make it a more playable and challenging army.   It also assumes you know something about the Adeptus Arbites, as I haven’t written any fluff up yet.  It will get added though, not to worry!  
&gt;For now though, all you need to know that the Arbites are the planetary Imperial Police force.  They are independent of the planet’s Governor, reporting directly to the Adeptus Terra.  Indeed, one of their primary functions is to keep a careful watch on the planetary rulers for signs of treasonous activities!  They are not really there for actual armed combat or to fight wars, but more for maintaining order, suppressing uprisings, crushing any criminal or revolutionary activities, and generally keeping the populace in line.  As such, most of their weapons are not lethal but more aimed at crowd control.  They have limited heavy firepower to deal with armed insurrectionists, but for heavy opposition or actual alien invasions their main job is to hold out as long as possible and call for aid.   
&gt;Da Rules
&gt;Rulebook/Codex Updates
&gt;You may choose the following from the Heroes of the Imperium section of the 40K Rulebook to join your Arbites force: Inquisitor, Missionary, Confessor (all count as HQ selections).  A Preacher may be chosen to lead an Arbites Patrol Team; if chosen though the unit cannot upgrade to a Proctor though.
&gt;One Assassin may be chosen as per Codex: Assassins for an Arbites force.
&gt;One Judge chosen from the list below may be added to a Imperial Guard or Sisters of Battle army as an HQ choice.   A Marshall may be included as a unit leader in the same manner as a Preacher.   
&gt;One Patrol Team may be included as a Troops force selection choice in any Space Marine (except Dark Angels), Imperial Guard, or Sisters of Battle force (or any other forces of the Imperium that additionally be created), unless specifically stated otherwise.
&gt;
&gt;Special Rules
&gt;Arbite forces have a Strategy Rating of 1D6 (but may re-roll their first roll), and a Vehicle Leadership Value of 7 for campaign use.   For Missions involving Sentries, use ten Patrol Team Arbitrators (Initiative 3).
&gt;Call for Backup!
&gt;Depending on the size of the enemy they face, a beleaguered Arbite precinct will often call on reinforcements.  Only one unit of reinforcements can be taken and can use any unit options it would have normally.  Each starts the game in Reserve, even if the mission does not use that special rule.   They will enter play from the Arbites side of the board (or a random board side if the Arbites did not start from a side).
&gt;Reinforcements do not count towards your normal force selections, but any points spent on reinforcements do count towards your army points value.
&gt;Enemy Size:	Reinforcements:
&gt;0-1500		Nothing to see here, go about your business!    No reinforcements allowed
&gt;1501-2000	Just a minor disturbance!  One Imperial Guard Infantry squad or one Hive Gang Militia unit*
&gt;2001-2500	For Church & State!  One Battle Sisters Squad or any other options for lower points forces
&gt;2501 and higher	Call out the Marines!  One Space Marine Tactical Squad** or any other options for lower points forces
&gt;* See Codex: Armageddon for details
&gt;** Or the equivalent depending on the Chapter (Grey Hunters for Space Wolves, Battle Squad for Black Templars, etc) 
&gt;
&gt;The Thin Blue Line
&gt;Arbite forces are commonly the final line of defense on many Imperial planets, knowing that they must hold on until off-planet forces can arrive.  They also command valuable munitions and communications equipment, which enemy forces are eager to capture as quickly as possible.   
&gt;An Adeptus Arbites force may always choose to be Defender in any missions where Attacker and Defender designations are used.
&gt;
&gt;Precinct Defenses
&gt;In any missions allowing the Arbites force to use Fortifications, the player may choose Turret Emplacements using the rules from the Imperial Armor book with the following changes:
&gt;Crew will be 3 Arbitrators armed with Arbite Shotguns
&gt;Each Turret Emplacement counts as a Heavy Support option
&gt;Only weapons costing 50 points or less can be used
&gt;Heavy Webbers (+20 points) and Water Cannons (+10 points) are also weapon options
&gt;Weapons & Wargear
&gt;Arbite Characters can requisition weapons and wargear as per the Armoury list in Codex: Imperial Guard.  Only Judges and Marshalls may choose as Officers and Commissars, and a Judge counts as a Colonel for wargear selection options.  All Arbites characters may also choose from the Arbites Armoury list below:
&gt;Weapons:
&gt;Suppression Shield: Gives user +2 to their Armor Save in Close Combat (this cannot take their Armor Save to better than a 2+ however).  Although a Suppression Shield is not a Weapon as such, it counts as a single-handed weapon because nothing else can be used by the arm carrying the shield.  
&gt;6 points
&gt;Shock Maul: Counts as a Single-handed Close Combat Weapon.
&gt;1 point
&gt;Arbites Shotgun: This can fire a regular shotgun shell or special Executioner rounds (R18”, S4, AP5, Assault 1).  Executioner shots may re-roll a miss (just as if it was a linked weapon).  Like a regular Shotgun, it counts as a two-handed weapon.
&gt;3 points.
&gt;Shock Shield: same as Suppression Shield, but also each round one enemy in contact (chosen by the Arbite player) with it at start close combat must make their regular saving throw (armor or any other type they may have).  If they fail, they must strike at -1 Initiative in that combat.  
&gt;10 points.
&gt;Power Maul: Counts as a Single-handed Power Weapon, but only  negates armor saves in the first round of a combat as it needs time to recharge between use.  After that it counts as a regular Close Combat Weapon for the remainder of that combat.
&gt;7 points.
&gt;Wargear:
&gt;Book of Law: Judge or Marshall only.  All Arbite units within 6” of the model may always test to Regroup, even if below 50% Strength or within 6” of the enemy.
&gt;15 points.
&gt;Arbites Bike: Independent Characters only.  Can only be taken if the rest of the unit is allowed to take a bike as well.  Functions exactly as a regular Space Marine bike, but is armed with a twin-linked Autogun.  This may be upgraded to a twin-linked Boltgun for +10 points.
&gt;25 points.
&gt;Power Armor: Each precinct usually has a few precious suits of this highly valued armor for their higher ranking officers.  Power Armor gives the user an Armor Save of 3+, and cannot be taken by models on horseback due to the weight.
&gt;15 points
&gt;
&gt;New Weapon Options
&gt;Arbite Grenade Launchers can fire Frag and Krak rounds as normal, plus two new rounds designed specifically for Riot/Crowd Control.  They may only effect living creatures, so Vehicles, Demons, Necrons, Thousand Sons, Avatars, Wraithguard, etc. are not effected.
&gt;Take-Down: This releases a concentrated mix incapacitating gases designed to seep into skin and irritate eyes.  When the round explodes it also sends out broadband ultrasonics to effect hearing and disorientate the enemy.  
&gt;S3, AP-, Blast marker.  If casualties occur no-one dies but the unit is Pinned as they become incapacitated; units immune to Pinning are unaffected.  Open-topped vehicles are effected on a D6 roll of 1 with a D3 result on the Glancing Hit table.
&gt;Sunburst:  When it detonates this round ignites like a small star, blinding any models nearby as well as blistering exposed skin.  The intense multi-spectral light is enough to usually overload any vision protection systems.
&gt;S-, AP-, Blast marker. All models touching template must make their saving throw (Armor, Cover, Invulnerable, or any others they might have) or the unit must take a test for Pinning.  Units immune to Pinning are unaffected. Open-topped vehicles are effected on a D6 roll of 1 with a Crew Shaken result.
&gt; 
&gt;
&gt;New Vehicle Upgrades:
&gt;Riot Plow: Special plow mounting is affixed to the tank, with sloped blades designed to push crowds away from the tank.  Any model attempting to perform a Death or Glory attack against the tank must first roll equal to or under their Initiative (a roll of 1 automatically fails).  If they fail, they cannot do the attack but are otherwise unharmed; move the models to the side of the tank.  If they pass, they can conduct their attack as normal.  Note you must declare all models attempting the Death or Glory attack before making any Initiative checks.  A Riot Plow also acts as a Rough Terrain Modification, so not much point taking both of them &lt;g&gt;.
&gt;15 points.
&gt;
&gt;New Vehicle Weaponry:
&gt;Heavy Webber:  Crowd control device that sprays out a sticky liquid that forms solid webbing on contact with the air.   More fluff later – for now, think Spiderman.
&gt;To fire, place the flamer template as normal; all models touched are hit automatically and cover ignored. Each must roll a D6 and add that to its Strength.  They may add any special close combat effects such as Power Fists, and having a Power Weapon allows them to add +1 to their Strength. Big Gunz/Support Weapons that are hit count as having a Strength of 5.  On a result of 8 or higher, the model has broken free and suffers no effects.  If the score is 7 or less, or the D6 roll was a 1, the model suffers one wound (normal Armor or Invulnerable saves allowed).  Units that take any casualties must test for Pinning as they struggle to get out of the webbing, even if immune from Pinning (use a Ld 10 if the unit has no Ld value).   Big Gunz/Support Weapons that fail their roll cannot fire in the following turn.
&gt;A unit that was previously Pinned by a Heavy Webber is even more likely to fall victim to its effects, and must take their Pinning test with a -1 modifier for each consecutive turn spent Pinned.   A unit Pinned due to webbing fights at a -1 Initiative in an Assault’s first round.
&gt;Vehicles can also be effected by the tangling webs.  Roll 2D6, adding a further D6 if the vehicle did not move in the previous turn, and total the sum.   If the score equals or beats the Armor Value, the vehicle must take an immediate Difficult Terrain Test.  Skimmers effected instead take a D3 roll on the Glancing Hit table.  Walkers and any other vehicles with a WS test as per regular Models above, but if they fail they must take the Difficult Terrain Test like a normal vehicle next turn.
&gt;Water Cannon: Standard crowd control device, cheap and ideal for non-lethal crowd dispersal.  
&gt;R12”, S4, AP6, Heavy 3
&gt;Any model “wounded” is actually knocked to his feet, and the unit must take a Pinning test even if immune to Pinning (use a Ld 10 if the unit has no Ld value).   Open-topped vehicles that are hit are effected on a D6 roll of 1 with a D3 result on the Glancing Hit table.
&gt; HQ
&gt;(0-1) Judge
&gt;Profile	Points/Model	WS	BS	S	T	W	I	A	Ld	Sv
&gt;Judge	45	4	4	3	3	3	4	3	10	4+
&gt;Independent Character:  Unless accompanied by a Bodyguard, a Judge is an Independent Character and follows all normal rules for Independent Characters from the Warhammer 40,00 Rulebook.
&gt;Options:  Judges may choose additional equipment from the Armory as normal. 
&gt;Special Rules: Any Arbites unit within 6” of a Judge may make all Morale and Pinning tests using his Leadership.
&gt;Bodyguard:   A Judge may be accompanied by an Escort Squad; see the entry below for details.  Note that the Judge and Escort Squad count as a single HQ choice.
&gt;
&gt;Marshall
&gt;Profile	Points/Model	WS	BS	S	T	W	I	A	Ld	Sv
&gt;Marshall	25	4	4	3	3	2	3	2	9	4+
&gt;Independent Character:  Unless accompanied by a Bodyguard, a Marshall is an Independent Character and follows all normal rules for Independent Characters from the Warhammer 40,00 Rulebook.
&gt;Options: Marshalls may choose additional equipment from the Armory as normal.
&gt;Bodyguard:   A Marshall may be accompanied by an Escort Squad; see the entry below for details.  Note that the Marshall and Escort Squad count as a single HQ choice.
&gt;Detective
&gt;Profile	Points/Model	WS	BS	S	T	W	I	A	Ld	Sv
&gt;Detective	20	3	3	3	3	1	3	1	8	4+
&gt;Independent Character:  A Detective is an Independent Character and follows all normal rules for Independent Characters from the Warhammer 40,00 Rulebook.
&gt;Options:  Detectives may choose additional equipment from the Armory as normal.
&gt;
&gt;Special Rules:  I’m experimenting with two different ones.  The first is really based no more on a desire among many players for Judge Anderson to appear in the list &lt;g&gt;, the second is perhaps a bit more “realistic.”  Feedback please on which you like better!
&gt;Option 1: Psychic Power: Scan  This acts like a Scanner and also a Searchlight for Night Fighting missions, but with a shorter range.  The Detective takes a Psychic Test, and if he passes he can make like a Searchlight with an 18” range, or at start of game suppress any Infiltrators within 24” and force them to be repositioned.  Unlike a normal Searchlight, he doesn’t illuminate himself when using his power and thus specially cannot be targeted.  Scan can also force any enemy models concealed for any reason within 2D6” to be revealed.
&gt;Option 2: Special Rules: Undercover Cop  
&gt;Detectives are specially trained to infiltrate and gather intelligence on enemy actions.  They also use a wide network of informants and spies, all designed to keep the Precinct aware of any possible anti-Imperial activities or alien landings.   This helps ensure that while the Arbites may not be on the offensive in the attack, at the least they are not taken unawares.   To represent this, if the Arbite force contains a Detective then it may re-roll it’s dice roll for deciding who goes first.
&gt;
&gt;Escort Squad
&gt;Depending on the character, one Arbite unit may be chosen as his Escort Squad.  The team chosen has all normal options, but may not upgrade a member to Proctor.
&gt;Judge – Combat Team, Shock Team, or Patrol Team
&gt;	Note – if his Combat Team is in Power Armor, the Judge must also take Power Armor
&gt;Marshall – Rapid Pursuit Team, Patrol Team
&gt;Options:  One member of an Escort Team may be upgraded to Precinct Standard Bearer for +10 points, using the rules for Standard Bearers from Codex: Imperial Guard.  He may choose either a Holy Relic or Regimental Standard, again using the rules and points values from that codex.  
&gt; Elites
&gt;
&gt;Arbites Shock Team
&gt;Profile	Points/Model	WS	BS	S	T	W	I	A	Ld	Sv
&gt;Arbitrator	12	3	3	3	3	1	3	1	7	4+
&gt;Proctor	+7	3	3	3	3	1	3	2	8	4+
&gt;Squad: The unit consists of between 5 and 10 Arbitrators. 
&gt;Weapons: Each member is armed with a Suppression Shield and Shock Maul.
&gt;Options:  The entire unit may be armed with any of the following: Frag Grenades (+1 point per model), Krak Grenades (+2 points per model), Smoke/Blind Grenades (+2 points per model).
&gt;Character: One Arbitrator may be upgraded to a Proctor for +7 points, and may choose additional equipment from the Armory except for special access items as noted.
&gt;Transport: The unit may be transported in an Chimera or Rhino (see Transport section for details). This will not count as a further selection for the army.  
&gt;Arbites Combat Team
&gt;Profile	Points/Model	WS	BS	S	T	W	I	A	Ld	Sv
&gt;Arbitrator	13	3	3	3	3	1	3	1	7	4+
&gt;Proctor	+7	3	3	3	3	1	3	2	8	4+
&gt;Squad: The unit consists of between 5 and 10 Arbitrators. 
&gt;Weapons:  Each member is armed with a Boltgun.
&gt;Options: Up to two models can be issued one of the following: Flamer (+8 pts), Grenade Launcher (+10 pts), Heavy Stubber (+10 points).
&gt;One Combat Team per Arbites force may upgrade all members to Power Armor at +10 points per model.
&gt;Character: One Arbitrator may be upgraded to a Proctor for +7 points, and may choose additional equipment from the Armory except for special access items as noted.  If leading a Combat Team in Power Armor, the Proctor must also take Power Armor.
&gt;Transport: The unit may be transported in an Chimera or Rhino (see Transport section for details). This will not count as a further selection for the army.  
&gt;
&gt; 
&gt;(0-1) Arbites Sniper Support Squad
&gt;Profile	Points/Team	WS	BS	S	T	W	I	A	Ld	Sv
&gt;Sniper Team	38	3	4	3	3	1	3	1	7	4+
&gt;Squad: The Squad consists of 1 to 3 two-man teams.  Each team operates on its own, and counts as a separate unit for purposes of Victory Points.  Sniper teams cannot claim board quarters.
&gt;Weapons:  One Arbite in each team is armed with a Sniper Rifle and Autopistol and the other with a Boltgun. 
&gt;Special Rules
&gt;Take out the Leader! Arbite Snipers are specially trained to pick off Riot leaders or other members of importance, as this is usually the best way to quell any uprisings.  If a Sniper rolls a 6 to hit, he may apply the hit to any member of the target unit (within Line of Sight and weapon range) rather than allowing the enemy play to decide who is hit.
&gt;Superior Training: Sniper Teams are supremely dedicated and specially trained to fight independently.  They never need take a Morale Test for shooting casualties, and can always attempt to Regroup if below 50% strength.  They are also immune from Last Man Standing tests.  
&gt;Infiltrate:  Sniper Support Teams may set up via the Infiltrators rule, but only if the mission allows that scenario rule.  Otherwise they must set up as normal.
&gt; Troops
&gt;Arbites Patrol Team
&gt;Profile	Points/Model	WS	BS	S	T	W	I	A	Ld	Sv
&gt;Arbitrator	11	3	3	3	3	1	3	1	7	4+
&gt;Proctor	+7	3	3	3	3	1	3	2	8	4+
&gt;Squad: The unit consists of between 5 and 20 Arbitrators. 
&gt;Weapons:  Each member is armed with an Arbites Shotgun.
&gt;Options: One model may upgrade to a Grenade Launcher (+7 points) or Bolt Gun (+2 points).
&gt;Character: One Arbitrator may be upgraded to a Proctor for +7 points, and may choose additional equipment from the Armory except for special access items as noted.
&gt;Transport: The unit may be transported in a Rhino (see Transport section for details). This will not count as a further selection for the army.  They can fit all 20 into a Rhino, but it will count as Open-Topped while there are more than 11 models inside (the extra Arbites are riding on the running boards, 5 to a side, using side-mounted hand-holds).  Only ½ of the models can still fire though, as the extras are holding on with both hands to the rails.
&gt;Penal Legion 
&gt;Profile	Points/Model	WS	BS	S	T	W	I	A	Ld	Sv
&gt;Penal Legionnaire	5	3	2	3	3	1	3	1	5	-
&gt;Warden	15	3	3	3	3	1	3	1	8	4+
&gt;Squad: The unit consists of one Warden leading 10-20 scum of the galaxy, each hoping to live through the combat and possibly be rewarded with a parole.  You may not field more Penal Legion units than you have Arbite Patrol Teams in your army, and no other character will ever join the unit.
&gt;Weapons: Penal Legionnaires are armed lasguns, each weapon fitted a special IFF system so that they cannot fire upon Imperial forces.  They also carry an assortment of crude close combat weapons.
&gt;Character: The Penal Legion is lead by an Arbite Warden, armed with an Arbites Shotgun and the collar controls. He may choose additional equipment from the Armory except for special access items as noted.
&gt;Penal Legion Collars:  
&gt;Frenzon:  Once per game at any time, the Warden can activate special Frenzon chemical injectors in the collars.  This gives the rest of the unit +1 Attack and +1 Initiative for the rest of the turn.
&gt;Explosive: If the unit fails any Morale or Pinning Tests (or is automatically fails such a test), the Warden may detonate one explosive collar, instantly killing one of the legionnaires.  The unit may then re-take the test, using the Warden’s base Leadership of 8.  No negative modifiers are used, due to the highly inspirational nature of the collar detonation!.  This may only be done once per test however – if they fail again, they fail.  If the Warden is killed, the unit will take a Morale test using only their own Leadership of 5.  If they pass, they fight on with newly instilled faith in their Emperor.  If they fail, the unit disperses from play as the cowards run for freedom!
&gt;Arbites Cadet Team
&gt;Profile	Points/Model	WS	BS	S	T	W	I	A	Ld	Sv
&gt;Cadet	7	3	3	3	3	1	3	1	6	5+
&gt;Proctor	15	3	3	3	3	1	3	2	8	4+
&gt;Squad: The unit consists of between one Arbite Proctor and 4-9 Cadets.
&gt;Weapons:  Cadets are wear Flak Armor (5+ Armor Save) and are armed with a Close Combat Weapon and Autopistol.  
&gt;Options: One Cadet may be upgraded to carry a Bolt Pistol (+4 points), Boltgun (+4 points) or Arbites Shotgun (+3 points).
&gt;Character: The Proctor wears Carapace Armor (4+ Armor Save) and is armed with an Arbites Shotgun.  He may choose additional equipment from the Armory except for special access items as noted.
&gt;
&gt;(0-1) Kayninez Team
&gt;Profile	Points/Model	WS	BS	S	T	W	I	A	Ld	Sv
&gt;Kayninez	6	3	0	3	4	1	4	2	5	-
&gt;Handler	15	3	3	3	3	1	3	1	8	4+
&gt;Squad: The unit consists of 5-10 Kayninez plus a Handler.  It cannot be transported.
&gt;Weapons:  Teeth and claws!
&gt;Character: The team is lead by an Arbite Handler, armed with an Arbites Shotgun.  He may choose additional equipment from the Armory except for special access items as noted.
&gt;Special Rules: 
&gt;Kayninez are genetically enhanced dogs, specially bread and trained for Arbite use in crowd control.  They Move 6”, and can Assault 12” (if assaulting through Difficult Terrain, roll 2D6 and double the highest for their Assault movement).  This often means they will run ahead of their Handler to engage the enemy.  If more than 2” from their Handler, both Handler and dogs must attempt to regain unit coherency in their Movement Phase if possible.  The bloodthirsty nature of the Kayninez means they will always Pursue if their enemy Falls Back in an Assault however, unless they can restrain themselves by passing a Leadership Test.   
&gt;If the Handler is killed, the pack is removed from play.  Otherwise, they can always use his Leadership, no matter how far away they are from him.
&gt;
&gt;Transport
&gt;The Adeptus Arbites commonly use two main vehicles for transport: the Rhino (as per Codex: Space Marines) and the Chimera (as per Codex: Imperial Guard).  Note that they may only have the vehicle upgrades listed below though, and BS3 for both tanks.  Each can carry 10 Arbites plus an extra character model (11 in all), except in the case of  Patrol Team special rules for their Rhino.  Other Arbite tanks can only take the upgrades listed in their entry.
&gt;Vehicle Upgrades:
&gt;Arbite Chimera and Rhino vehicles may only take the following Vehicle Upgrades from Codex: Imperial Guard
&gt;Extra Armor, Pintle Mounted Storm Bolter, Rough Terrain Modifications, Searchlight, Smoke Launchers.
&gt;They may also both take the new vehicle upgrade Riot Plow.
&gt; Fast Attack
&gt;Arbites Rapid Pursuit Team
&gt;Profile	Points/Model	WS	BS	S	T	W	I	A	Ld	Sv
&gt;Arbitrator	10	3	3	3	3	1	3	1	7	4+
&gt;Proctor	+8	3	3	3	3	1	3	2	8	4+
&gt;Squad: The unit consists of between 3 and 10 Arbitrators.   The team must all be mounted on bikes at +10 points per model or on horseback (or the local planetary equivalent) for +4 points per model.  If on bikes, they gain a +1 Toughness as normal.  Note the entire team must be mounted the same way – no mixing bikes & horses!
&gt;Weapons:  Each member is armed with an Arbites Shotgun and Autopistol.   Arbite bikes are armed with a twin-linked Autogun.
&gt;Options: One model may replace their Shotgun with either a Grenade Launcher for +6 points or Boltgun for +4 points.   
&gt;The entire unit may be armed with Frag Grenades at +1 point per model.
&gt;Arbite Bikes can be upgraded to carry a twin-linked Boltgun for +8 points per bike.
&gt;Character: One Arbitrator may be upgraded to a Proctor for +8 points, and may choose additional equipment from the Armory except for special access items as noted.   Units with a Proctor normally represent the elite riders in the Precinct, and due to their superior skills may also choose to move at a Trot.  See Codex: Imperial Guard for details on this special rule.

&gt;Castigator Riot Control Vehicle 
&gt;Profile	Points	Front	Side	Rear	BS
&gt;Castigator	50	11	11	10	3
&gt;Type: Tank, Open Topped
&gt;Crew: Arbitrators.  
&gt;Weapons: The Castigator must be armed with either a turret mounted Heavy Webber at +25 points or Water Cannon at +15 points.   
&gt;It also has a Searchlight and a Riot Plow as a built-in Vehicle Upgrades.
&gt;Transport: A Castigator may carry up to 6 Arbites.
&gt;Options:  The Castigator may take the following vehicle upgrades from Codex: Imperial Guard:
&gt;Pintle-Mounted Storm Bolter, Mine Sweeper, Smoke Launchers, Track Guards, Extra Armor.
&gt;Thunderhead Demolition Vehicle 
&gt;Profile	Points	Front	Side	Rear	BS
&gt;Thunderhead	45	11(12)	11	10	3
&gt;Type: Tank.
&gt;Crew: Arbitrators.  
&gt;Weapons:  Thunderhead Ram (see below).
&gt;Options:  The Thunderhead may take the following vehicle upgrades from Codex: Imperial Guard:
&gt;Pintle-Mounted Storm Bolter, Searchlight, Smoke Launchers, Track Guards, Extra Armor, Rough Terrain Modifications.
&gt;Thunderhead Ram: This is a special reinforced Hydraulic Ram attached to front of the basic Rhino chassis, used in Riot and Crowd Control situations to destroy civilian vehicles, knock down barricades, etc.  Reinforcing mechanisms and hydraulics take up all transport capability.  If the Ram impacts an enemy vehicle, both players roll a D6 and add the Armor Value of the sides touching (the Thunderhead will always roll for Front, since that is where the Ram is located).  The Arbite player also rolls an additional D6 for each full 4” the Thunderhead moved that turn in a straight line.  If the enemy vehicle was Immobilized, or the Thunderhead is striking a fixed emplacement like a Bunker, the Arbite player may re-roll the one of the dice before picking the highest as his roll.
&gt;The low scoring vehicle takes a Glancing Hit, but cannot get a result any greater than the difference between the two scores.  If a tie, both vehicles take a Crew Shaken result.  Skimmers cannot be Rammed, nor Flyers for obvious reasons (unless they are landed).   Only Immobilized Walkers can be Rammed (as otherwise they simple dodge the more cumbersome tank).  
&gt;While operational, the ram adds +1 to the front Armor value.  If the Thunderhead Tank takes a Weapon Destroyed result in a Ram attempt, the weapon must be the ram; it is torn off and cannot be used again.  Otherwise the Thunderhead Ram counts as a regular weapon for damage results.
&gt;(0-1) Huntsman Command and Control Vehicle 
&gt;Profile	Points	Front	Side	Rear	BS
&gt;Huntsman	100	12	10	10	3
&gt;Type: Tank, Open Topped
&gt;Crew: Arbitrators.  A special 5 man squad is also carried by the Huntsman, consisting of a Marshall (armed with a Master-Crafted Shotgun) and 4 Arbitrators (3 armed with Shotguns and 1 with a Grenade Launcher).  The Marshall acts as tank commander while the Arbitrators serve as a defensive firebase. The squad can only leave the Huntsman if it is destroyed.  Otherwise they function as a normal transported squad – they can target independently of the vehicle at another target unit, and all can fire since the vehicle is Open-Topped.  Full vehicle Victory Points are only scored if all the squad members are killed as well, otherwise no more than ½ of the Huntsman’s points cost can be awarded no matter how badly it is damaged.
&gt;Weapons:  A single Hull mounted and two Sponson mounted Heavy Webbers. 
&gt;Options:  The Huntsman may take the following vehicle upgrades from Codex: Imperial Guard:
&gt;Pintle-Mounted Storm Bolter, Searchlight, Mine Sweeper, Smoke Launchers, Track Guards, Extra Armor, Rough Terrain Modifications.
&gt;It may also be given the new vehicle upgrade Riot Plow.
&gt;Command and Control:  The Huntsman also serves as a mobile targeting control center for the Arbite force.  It carries an array of command & control equipment, with multiple video systems displaying the gathered data for the Marshall.  He can then relay this information to fellow Arbite units.  The Huntsman counts as having the vehicle upgrade Improved Comms (see Codex: Imperial Guard for details, but note it will only effect other Adeptus Arbites units for Reserve rolling). This allows any one Arbite unit within 12” of the Huntsman to re-roll any shooting misses once per turn, as long as the Huntsman also had Line of Sight to that target (note this cannot be used if Smoke Launchers were used that turn!).
&gt;Riot Control Firing Modes: All three Heavy Webbers on the Huntsman are linked to sophisticated motion detection and IFF sensors, and then networked into an onboard firing computer.  When engaged, this system automatically targets the largest enemy masses in its fire arc, without the need for human control.  Since the primary purpose is to subdue the maximum number of rioters as quickly as possible, this is the normal firing mode.  It can be disengaged for direct operator control (for more precise targeting of mob leaders, for example), but at the expense of the more rapid automatic response.  
&gt;To represent this, all three Heavy Webbers count as a single weapon for determining how many weapons the vehicle can fire (and thus it can fire all three even if it moved up to 6”).  All three templates must be placed as per normal targeting rules though from the 40K Rulebook, and each must target the closest unit in its fire arc.  Alternatively, the automatic system may be disengaged and a single Heavy Webber may be singled out for direct firing.  One Heavy Webber template may be placed in any direction, not just to cover the maximum number of models as normal (it can still only target a single unit though).  The other two Heavy Webbers firing on automatic control will target as normal.  When this is done though each Heavy Webber will count as a separate weapon for firing purposes.
