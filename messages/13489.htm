TYRANID ARMY LIST<br>
Bioweapons list<br>
Last revised: 3/4/00<br>
Tyranid Ranged Bioweapons<br>
Tyranid ranged bioweapons are a part of their bodies, symbiote organisms melded to them from inception. To represent this their rate of fire and strength depend on the creature carrying them as detailed below. Bioweapons range and AP value characteristics are set by the type of weapon. A creature with two or more ranged bioweapons may only choose to fire one of them per shooting phase.<br>
Strength: Ranged bioweapons have a Strength equal to the creature firing, modified as shown in the bioweapons profiles below. The toxins sacs biomorphs (+1 strength) does increase the strength of ranged bioweapons carried by the creature. Bio-weapons are limited to a maximum of strength 10.<br>
Rate of Fire: Many bioweapons are Assault X weapons. These count as assault weapons get one shot per attack on the creatures basic profile (ie before modified by any other bioweapons), 2X weapons get twice the attacks in shots and so on.<br>
For example a Gaunt (1 attack) with a Devourer (Assault 2X) fires 2 shots. A warrior (2 attacks) would fire four shots.<br>
Ranged Bioweapon Symbiotes<br>
Fleshborers: Despite its outward appearance of a more conventional gun, the Fleshborer is in fact a brood nest for sharp-fanged borer beetles. These are normally passive until a massive electro-chemical shock hurls them forth to expend their life energy frenziedly boring through armour, flesh and bone. <br>
Rng	Str	AP	Type:	<br>
12”	As creature +1	-	Assault X	<br>
Spinefists: A Spinefist is a symbiote weapon-creature carried by Tyranids for close quarter fighting. The Spinefist launches a salvo of diamond-hard spines coated with a lethal neuro-toxin in a broad pattern when stimulated. <br>
Rng	Str	AP	Type:	<br>
12”	As creature	5	Assault X	<br>
Devourers: The aptly named Devourer is a conical lump of flesh infested by writhing worm-like organisms with black, shiny heads. When the weapon is triggered a bio-electrical jolt hurls a shower of flesh-worms at the target which immediately start burrowing inside the victim's body. A creature infested by flesh-worms is driven mad with agony as the worms eat their way through its nervous system to the brain and devour it. <br>
Rng	Str	AP	Type:	<br>
12”	As creature -1	6	Assault 2X	<br>
Death spitters: Death Spitters are complex multi-creature symbiotes which launch a highly corrosive maggot-like organism with a powerful muscle spasm. Wherever the creature strikes gobbets of volatile fluid are splattered across a wide area, searing exposed flesh and melting through armour with equal vigour. <br>
Rng	Str	AP	Type:	<br>
18”	As creature +1	5	Assault 1/blast	<br>
Barbed Stranglers: The barbed strangler is a seed fired from a simple launcher which is little more than a muscled tube. The strangler seed-pod grows to maturity in seconds, spreading and growing in all direction with blinding speed, sending out hooked tendrils to bind and then tear apart its prey. Studies of the creature have revealed it to be plant-like with similarities to some terrestrial xeromorphs. <br>
Rng	Str	AP	Type:	<br>
24”	As creature -2	-	Assault 1/ord. blast	<br>
Venom cannon: The Venom cannon is a long, powerful bio-weapon which fires salvoes of highly corrosive poison crystals encrusted with a metallic residue. The symbiote fires using an electro-static charge to accelerate its deadly ammunition to supersonic speeds. A target struck by the Venom cannon is either killed by the impact and blast of electrical energy or by corrosive fragments from the poison crystals when they shatter. Even vehicle armour can be penetrated by the crystals, leading to poisoned crew members and shattered equipment, although the lack of explosive impact reduces lethality. <br>
Rng	Str	AP	Type:	<br>
36”	As creature +2	4	Assault X	<br>
Note: Venom cannon can only achieve glancing hits against vehicles, count any penetrating hits as glancing hits instead.<br>
Close Combat Symbiotes<br>
All close combat symbiotes count as special close combat attacks and are therefore only effective if the Tyranid model is in base to base combat or within 2” and has the leaping special rule. However, a Tyranid creature can use all of its close combat symbiotes in an assault and is not only limited to using one at a time like most models.<br>
Scything Talons: Many Tyranid creatures have long stabbing and slashing claws of razor-edged bone or chitin. The reach and sweep of such talons enables them attack murderously at close quarters, eviscerating their victims with a flurry of blows.<br>
Tyranid creatures with scything talons count as having two close combat weapons in an assault and so gain +1 attack. Creatures with two sets of Scything talons gain +2 attacks in close combat instead of +1. No more than +2 attacks can be gained and the number of shots with Assault X weapons is not increased by scything talons. Note that this is the only way that Tyranids gain extra attacks in close combat for multiple weapons, their number of limbs is accounted for in their basic profiles.<br>
Rending claws: Rending claws are short and powerful, tipped with diamond-hard spikes or talons. They are quite capable of crushing plasteel and ripping through the thickest armour with their vice-like grip.<br>
Tyranid creatures with rending claws will inflict a wound automatically and ignore armour saves just like a power weapon with close combat attacks which roll a 6 to hit. Other attacks which hit on a roll other than 6 must roll to wound as normal and the victim receives their normal armour saving throw.<br>
If a creature with rending claws rolls a 6 for its armour penetration dice roll against a vehicle it rolls another D6 and adds the result to the total armour penetration score. For example a Tyranid Warrior hits a vehicle in close combat. The Tyranid player gets lucky and rolls a 6 for armour penetration, so he rolls the dice again and gets a 4, giving him an armour penetration score of 5 (the Warriors Strength) + 6 +4 = 15<br>
Lash Whips : Lash whips are living ropes of muscle and sinew which writhe and twist with a will of their own. In combat they strangle and bind, entangling creatures so that they are easy meat for the Tyranids.<br>
Enemy models in base contact with creatures equipped with lash whips reduce their number of attacks by one, to a minimum of one. Lash whips may not be used by creatures who are 2” away and using the Leaping special to count their full number of attacks.<br>
Biomorph enhancements<br>
Biomorph enhancements are grafted or bio-engineered combat modifications which are appended to the beast’s throat, chest, tail etc. These enhance the creature in combat without inhibiting its ability to carry and use other weapon-symbiotes.<br>
Implant Attack: Identifiable as a barbed stinger attached to a tail or tongue, implant attacks usually deliver corrosive pathogens, parasitic infections, organic acids or lethal toxins. Survivors of such attacks are rare.<br>
A model which fails its saving throw when wounded by a creature with an Implant attack suffers two wounds instead of one.<br>
Flesh hooks: Flesh hooks are formed out of carbon-based chitin with a monomolecular edge attached to lengths of exceptionally tough muscle fibre situated between a creatures ribs. The hooks are fired by a sharp intercostal muscle spasm, shooting out to allow the creature to snare their victims from a distance. The flesh hooks are also sometimes used as grapnels to allow creatures to scale vertical surfaces at great speed.<br>
A creature with flesh hooks counts as being equipped with frag grenades in close combat. In addition, creatures with flesh hooks count ‘vertically impassable’ pieces of terrain such as high walls or cliffs as difficult terrain.<br>
Bio Plasma: Some Tyranid creatures have the capacity to internally energise a form of bio-plasma which they vomit forth as a ball or bolt of blinding green fire. The plasmic material is held in their gut and energised by rasping plates in their oesophagus, this process makes a high-pitched screaming which precedes a bio-plasma attack.<br>
Creatures with bio plasma can make a single extra close combat attack, worked out at double the models Intiative (ie Intiative 8 for a Gargoyle, 4 for a Carnifex). Bio plasma can be used by models within 2” of the enemy as well as by models in base contact. The bio plasma hits on a roll of 4+ on a D6 regardless of the target type or WS. It inflicts a single hit with a Strength equal to the creature +1 (to a maximum of S10), normal armour saves are allowed. Remove models as you would other close combat casualties.<br>
Once bio plasma attacks have been resolved creatures make their other close combat attacks at their normal Intiative value. Note that since bio plasma kills count as close combat casualties a creature who starts the combat in base contact will get its full number of attacks (including benefits from close combat bioweapons), even if the model they are in base contact with is removed by bio plasma.<br>

SPECIAL RULES<br>
Tyranid Monstrous Creature: The Hive Tyrant is Tyranid monstrous creature and follows the special rules detailed on pxx.<br>
Mutable: The characteristics and weaponry of Hive Tyrants can be substantially altered by using the bio-genetic modification procedure detailed later.<br>
Tyrant’s Bodyguard: The Hive Tyrant may be accompanied by bodyguard of specially bio-constructed Tyranid Warriors. The tyrant’s guard do not count as a separate HQ choice. However a second brood of Tyrant Guards can be chosen as a second HQ choice if desired.<br>
Tyrant Guard Brood ***Genofixed Species ***45pts/model <br>
	WS	BS	S	T	W	I	A	Ld	Sv	<br>
Tyrant Guard	5	3	5	6	2	5	2	10	3+	<br>
Brood: The brood consists of between 2 and 3 Tyrant Guards.<br>
Bio Weapons: Lash whips, rending claws and spine shield (counts as spinefists)<br>
Options: The Tyrant Guard brood may be equipped with up to two biomorph enhancements chosen from the following list at the points cost indicated.<br>
Flesh Hooks 1 pts<br>
Implant attack 6 pts<p>
ELITES<br>
0-1 Lictors ***Genofixed Species *** 80 pts each <br>
	WS	BS	S	T	W	I	A	Ld	Sv	<br>
Lictor	6	-	6	4	3	6	2+1	10	5+	<br>
Brood: You may include between 1 and 3 Lictors as a single Elites choice, but only one choice may be made per army, thus you have a maximum of three in an army. Lictors are deployed as a single unit but do not need to be placed together and operate independently during the game.<br>
Bio Weapons: Lictors are armed with Scything talons, rending claws and Flesh Hooks<br>
SPECIAL RULES<br>
Secret Deployment: Before either side deploys their armies at the start of a battle the Tyranid player may deploy any of their Lictors secretly to represent them creeping into position. Lictors may only be secretly deployed in areas of cover which are outside the enemies’ deployment zone. Write down which Lictors are secretly deploying and exactly where they are (note if you are using the junglefight rules from Codex: Catachan simply treat Lictors as units that can use the ambush rules).<br>
The Tyranid player can reveal the location of a Lictor at the start of any Tyranid Shooting phase and place the model on the tabletop. Once the Lictor has been placed on the tabletop it is allowed to move, assault and fight normally.<br>
The opposing player can use units to reveal hidden Lictors by searching for them. A unit can declare it is searching at the start of the shooting phase, roll a D6 for it and on a 6 any Lictor(s) within 6” of the squad are revealed and placed on the tabletop immediately. Add +2 to the roll if the unit is armed with a weapon which uses a template (such as a flamer) as these are ideal for flushing out cover. If the unit contains a psyker or a model equipped with an auspex or scanner that model may not shoot while searching but Lictors within 6” are revealed automatically. A searching unit may still fire or move using fleet of foot in the shooting phase.<br>
Stealth: The Lictors’ chameleonic scales make it an extremely difficult target. A Lictor always receives a 5+ cover save even in the open. If the Lictor is actually in cover its cover saving throw is improved by +2, so for example it would receive a 3+ cover save in woods or jungles. A Lictor gains no benefits from its stealth while in close combat, reverting to its natural 5+ armour save for its chitinous armour. Sentries killed by a Lictor in close combat will only raise the alarm on a D6 roll of 6 instead or 4 or more.<br>
Fearless: Lictors are driven by the implacable alien will of the Hive mind. A Lictor never has to fall back and is assumed to automatically pass any morale checks it is required to take, even against attacks which normally force their target to fall back with no test taken. Lictors cannot be pinned.<br>
Hit and Run: Lictors may choose to leave close combat. Declare this at the end of any close combat phase, after all morale checks have been taken. The Lictor immediately falls back 3D6” and regroups at the end of its move. Enemy models may not pursue the Lictor but may consolidate.<br>
Independent Character: You may include between 1 and 3 Lictors as a single Elites choice. Lictors operate independently and so follow the rules for independent characters given on p74 of the Warhammer 40,000 rulebook. However Lictors can never join another unit and they always fight individually. Note that for the purposes of mission objectives Lictors cannot capture table quarters, hold objectives or count as surviving troops in a meat grinder battle.<br>
Tyranid Warrior Brood ***Mutable Genus ****27/model <br>

Bio Weapons: Ripper swarms have razor-sharp jaws and sharp mandibles.<br>
SPECIAL RULES<br>
Mindless: Rippers are relentless eating machines. A Ripper swarm never has to fall back and is assumed to automatically pass any morale checks it is required to take, even against attacks which normally force their target to fall back with no test taken. Rippers cannot be pinned. For the purposes of mission objectives Ripper swarms cannot capture table quarters, hold objectives or count as surviving troops in a meat grinder battle.<br>
Vulnerable to blasts: Temple and blast marker weapons inflict two wounds instead of one on Ripper swarms.<br>
Small targets: Ripper swarms in cover are extremely hard to hit so their cover save is improved by +1.<br>
Mutable Genus: The characteristics and weaponry of Ripper swarms can be substantially altered by using the bio-genetic modification procedure detailed later.<br>
Hormagaunt Brood ***Mutable Genus **** 9/model <br>
	WS	BS	S	T	W	I	A	Ld	Sv	<br>

Brood: The Brood consists of between 8 and 32 Hormagaunts.<br>
Bio Weapons: Scything talons.<br>
SPECIAL RULES<br>
Bounding Leap: Hormagaunts move 6” like other troops, however in the assault phase they may assault up to 12” (or double the distance of the dice roll if they move through difficult terrain). Hormagaunts advance and fall back 3D6”. In addition Hormagaunts count their full number of attacks in close combat if they are within 2” of an enemy model. Remember that when charging models must move into base to base contact with the enemy if they can reach them.<br>
Fleet of claw: Hormagaunts can race along extremely quickly by using all six limbs for locomotion. To represent this Hormagaunt broods can move another D6” in the shooting phase, ignoring penalties for difficult terrain.<br>
Mutable Genus: Hormagaunts are a species of the highly adaptive Gaunt genus. The characteristics and weaponry of Gaunt Species can be substantially altered by using the bio-genetic modification procedure detailed later.<p>

Ravener ***Genofixed Species *** 33 pts/model <br>
	WS	BS	S	T	W	I	A	Ld	Sv	<br>
Ravener	5	3	4	4	2	5	3	10	5+	<br>
Brood: The brood consists of between 1 and 6 Raveners.<br>

Scything Talons 8 pts <br>
Rending claws 8 pts <br>
Deathspitter 12 pts <br>
Devourer: 15 pts <br>
Spinefists 8 pts <br>
SPECIAL RULES<br>
Fast: Ravener move 9” in the movement phase and can make an assault move of up to 9”. When rolling for distance moved through difficult terrain add +3 to the highest roll. Raveners also roll 3D6 for fallback and pursuit distances.<br>
Gargoyle Brood ***Genofixed Species *** 10pts/model <br>
	WS	BS	S	T	W	I	A	Ld	Sv	<br>
Gargoyle	3	3	3	3	1	4	1	10	6+	<br>
Brood: The Brood consists of between 8 and 32 Gargoyles.<br>
Bio Weapons: Fleshborer and bio plasma attack<br>
SPECIAL RULES<br>
Wings: Gargoyles' wings allow them to move 12” in the movement phase and they advance or fallback 3D6” instead of 2D6”. Gargoyles ignore terrain moved over but may not enter difficult or impassable terrain due to their vulnerable wing membranes. Gargoyles forced to enter difficult or impassable terrain for any reason are removed as casualties.<br>
Fleet of wing: Gargoyles can fly faster if they don’t shoot. To represent this Gargoyles broods can move another D6” in the shooting phase if they do not shoot.<br>
Deep Strike: In the right circumstances Gargoyles can swoop down into battle, appearing almost anywhere on the battlefield. To represent this they may set up using the Deep Strike rules, but only if the mission allows for Deep Strike to be used. If the mission does not allow units to use the Deep Strike rules then the Gargoyles must set up normally with the rest of the army.<p>
HEAVY SUPPORT<br>

0-1 Biovores ***Genofixed Species *** 40 pts each <br>
	WS	BS	S	T	W	I	A	Ld	Sv	<br>
Biovore	3	3	3	4	2	1	1	10	-	<br>
Spore mine	0	0	1	4	1	1	0	10	-	<br>
Brood: You may include between 1 and 3 Biovore as a single Heavy Support choice, but only one choice may be made per army, thus you have a maximum of three in an army. Biovore are deployed as a single unit but do not need to be placed together and operate independently during the game.<br>
Bio Weapons: Biovores store and fire spore mines as their main weapons, defending themselves with tooth and claw if attacked. The spore mines available to each Biovore must be chosen from the following list at the points costs indicated. A Biovore carries enough spore mines of the types chosen to last the entire battle.<br>
Poison 12 pts<br>
Area of effect: Ordnance blast marker. Str special AP 4<br>
Poison mines always count as having a Strength equal to the targets Toughness. Therefore poison mines will normally wound on a D6 roll of 4 or more. Poison mines can only affect vehicles which are open-topped, but against open topped vehicles they inflict a single glancing hit automatically.<br>
Frag 10 pts.<br>
Area of effect: Ordnance blast marker. Str 4 AP 5<br>
Bio Acid. 16 pts<br>
Blast Marker: Flamer template. Str 3 AP 3<br>
Place the narrow end of the template in contact with the spore mine model and use the scatter dice to determine which direction the template is placed in, on a roll of a ‘hit’ the template is pointed towards the nearest enemy model. Acid spore mines roll 2D6 to penetrate vehicle armour.<br>
SPECIAL RULES<br>
Spore Mine: The Biovore works by firing a deadly living bomb, called a Spore Mine, towards the enemy. To fire the Biovore, place a Spore Mine model anywhere on the table to indicate the firing direction. Then make a range guess of up to 48” in much the same way as a barrage weapon (p58 of the Warhammer 40,000 rulebook) and move the spore mine to that distance from the Biovore in the direction indicated. Roll the Scatter dice and 2D6 and reposition the Spore Mine accordingly to determine the landing point of the mine. If a hit is rolled then the Spore Mine is bang on target and doesn’t scatter. Note that a line of sight is not needed to the target spot, and that Spore Mines do not cause pinning. Multiple Biovores do not form barrages, work out each shot separately.<br>
Once launched Spore mines follow the rules given in the Spore Mine rules on pXX. <br>
	Range	Strength	AP	Type	<br>
Biovore	G48	Varies	Varies	Heavy 1	<br>
Living Artillery: For the purposes of mission objectives Biovores cannot capture table quarters, hold objectives or count as surviving troops in a meat grinder battle.<br>
0-1 Zoanthropes ***Genofixed Species *** 34 pts each <br>

Zoanthrope	3	3	4	4	2	4	2	10	2+	<br>
Brood: You may include between 1 and 3 Zoanthropes as a single Heavy Support choice, but only one choice may be made per army, thus you have a maximum of three in an army. Zoanthropes are deployed as a single unit but do not need to be placed together and operate independently during the game.<br>
Bio Weapons: Zoanthropes have nothing but their basic claws and teeth (and awesome psychic powers) to fight with.<br>
Hive Mind powers<br>
Zoanthropes always have the following psychic power.<br>
Warp field<br>
In addition a Zoanthrope may be upgraded to use up to one further psychic power chosen from the following list at the points cost indicated.<br>
Catalyst 5 pts. <br>

SPECIAL RULES<br>
Living Artillery: For the purposes of mission objectives Zoanthropes cannot capture table quarters, hold objectives or count as surviving troops in a meat grinder battle.<p>
THE TYRANID HIVE SPECIAL RULES<br>
The Hive Mind and Synapse Creatures<br>
All Tyranids are united by the potent psychic imperatives of their shared Hive Mind. Some of the larger, more intelligent Tyranid creatures have vastly expanded synapse networks within their cortex that act as a psychic conduit for the directives of the Hive Mind, over-ruling the natural instincts of nearby Tyranid creatures.<br>
Any Tyranid unit with a model within 12” of a creature with synapse hive mind power (including the creature itself) ignores any Morale and pinning checks and automatically passes tests to regroup it is required to make. Note that regrouping only takes place at the beginning of the turn so a Tyranid unit which falls back can be destroyed by pursuers or crossfire.<br>
Tyranid Instinctive behaviour<br>
Beyond the immediate reach of the Hive Mind lesser Tyranid creatures will often revert to their basic, often animalistic instincts. To represent this at the beginning of the Tyranid turn any broods or outside synapse control range must take a morale check for being ‘All on your own’ (this being the equivalent situation for Tyranids), if the test is failed roll for the brood reaction on the Instinctive behaviour table below.<br>
Likewise Tyranid creatures which fail a morale check or pinning test while beyond the range of a creature with the synapse power will revert to their basic instincts. Roll on the table below to see how a Tyranid unit responds to failed pinning or morale checks when out of range of any synapse creatures.<br>
Tyranid Instinctive behaviour table <br>
D6 roll	Morale Check	Pinning Test	<br>
1-2	Fall back	Pinned	<br>
3-4	Lurk	Lurk	<br>
5-6	Attack!	Attack!	<br>
Fall back: The brood will start to falling back towards the nearest model with the Synapse Creature Hive Mind Power. If none are on the tabletop the brood will fall back towards the Tyranid players table edge.<br>
Pinned: The brood is pinned as per the normal rules.<br>
Lurk: The brood will start falling back towards the nearest terrain which will give them a cover save and is not closer to the enemy.<br>
Attack!: The brood snarls, bellows and hisses in a terrifying fashion and charges towards their attackers. Move the unit 2D6” towards the nearest enemy unit, if it makes contact with enemy models count this move as a sweeping advance. If the Tyranid unit is already in an assault fight another round of close combat immediately.<br>
Fast and Deadly<br>
Tyranid swarms move quickly across even the most inhospitable and broken ground under the mental lash of the hive mind. In battle Tyranids attack at the run and often creatures are trampled, forced over cliffs or drowned by the animalistic stampede as the swarms race forward. To represent this Tyranid creatures always roll one D6 more than normal when checking to see how far they can move through difficult ground (ie three D6 instead of two D6 in jungles and so on). However if a Tyranid brood of eight or more models rolls two or more 6’s on the dice it suffers one wound in the stampede, saving throws apply as normal. Synapse creatures still get to roll an extra dice but will not suffer wounds when moving through difficult ground due to their control of the creatures around them.<br>
Tyranid Monstrous Creatures<br>
Tyranid monstrous creatures combine some of the abilities of both independent characters and monstrous creatures. As such the following rules apply;<br>
Tyranid monstrous creatures can join units of other Tyranid creatures, but they may always be picked out as a separate target for enemy shooting unless the unit is of Tyrant Guards. A Tyranid unit including a Tyranid monstrous creature is limited to moving and assaulting at the speed of the slowest model in the unit.<br>
Tyranid monstrous creatures are fearless. They never have to fall back and are assumed to automatically pass any morale checks they are required to take, even against attacks which normally force their target to fall back with no test taken. Tyranid monstrous creatures cannot be pinned.<br>
Tyranid monstrous creatures can always choose to allocate their close combat attacks to enemy models in base to base contact with them or choose to shoot at a different target to the unit they have joined.<br>
Tyranid monstrous creatures may reroll the dice for moving through difficult terrain unless they have joined a unit.<br>
Tyranid monstrous creatures ignore enemy armour saves in close combat and roll 2D6 for armour penetration against vehicles in close combat.<br>
Tyranid monstrous creatures count as a unit of troops for victory conditions so they can capture table quarters, hold objectives or count as surviving troops in a meat grinder battle.<br>
“Shoot the big ones”<br>
Enemies of the Tyranids have learned many valuable lessons at a terrible cost in lives lost and blood shed. One of the most important stratagems has been teaching troops to pick the right targets from the swarm even in the heat of battle. Because of this an opposing player can freely choose to direct fire from his units at any Tyranid brood or creature within range in the shooting phase, line of fire is only blocked by terrain and vehicles.<br>
Spore Mines<br>
Spore Mines are very basic, geno-modified organisms which the Tyranids use as ‘living bombs’ most commonly launched from living artillery pieces called biovores. The mines are engorged sacs full of chemicals, viruses, toxins and poisons which drift slowly in the air currents, with nests of sensitive feelers dangling below questing for the heat and vibration which attracts them to their target. Although it is possible to still avoid the attention of a spore mine by moving carefully quietly, weapons discharges and other violent noises will stimulate a detonation with often fatal results.<br>
Due to their unique nature and mode of attack spore mines use a number of special rules.<br>
Movement: Spore Mines drift D6” in a random direction in each Tyranid movement phase, determined by rolling the scatter dice. On a roll of a ‘hit’ symbol on the scatter dice the Tyranid player may choose the direction of movement. Unlike most models a Spore Mine can move within 1” of enemy models and vehicles during its movement. Spore Mines cannot make assault moves.<br>
Detonation: If an enemy unit or vehicle shoots while there is a spore mine within 1” then the mine explodes. Resolve the detonation once the unit or vehicles’ firing has been completed. Place the appropriate template or markers over the spot where the spore mine explodes and resolve the results according to its type as described in the Tyranid army list. If a Spore Mine is reduced to zero wounds or otherwise killed, it will explode as detailed above. An enemy unit may treat all spore mine models within 6” of its members as a single target for shooting purposes. Spore mines can also be detonated by synaptic control, see the Tyranid Hive Mind Powers for details.<br>
Morale: Being essentially mindless a Spore Mine never has to fall back and is assumed to automatically pass any morale checks it is required to take, even against attacks which normally force their target to fall back with no test taken. Spore Mines cannot be pinned. For the purposes of mission objectives Spore Mines cannot capture table quarters, hold objectives or count as surviving troops in a meat grinder battle.<br>
Preliminary Barrage: Clusters of Spore Mines are often scattered over an area in tens of thousands as a kind of Tyranid preliminary bombardment, drifting down from the air currents when attracted by weapons fire. To represent this the Tyranid preliminary barrage scenario special rule (p135) is modified as follows. Only roll to hit units, not obstacles. Any units which are ‘hit’ on a roll of 6 have attracted D3 spore mines. The Tyranid player places these within 1” of the unit and then rolls the scatter dice for each and moves it 2D6” in the direction indicated. Roll a D6 to randomly to determine what kinds of spore mine appear: 1-2 Frag 3-4 Poison 5-6 Bio-acid.<br>
Tyranid Hive Mind powers<br>
Many Tyranid organisms exhibit psychic powers because they act as a conduit for the awesome energies of the Hive Mind. Any Tyranid creature with these powers is considered to be a psyker so will, for example, be vulnerable to the Dark Eldar Crucible of Malediction. Hive mind powers do not require a psychic test to use unless specifically stated in their description. Only those powers which require a psychic test to use may be cancelled by enemy psykers.<br>
Synapse Creature:<br>
This power functions continuously and does not require a psychic test to use. Any Tyranid unit with a model within 12” of a creature with this power, including the creature itself, ignore any Morale checks, pinning tests and automatically pass tests to regroup. Synapse dominated regrouping ignores the usual restrictions for not being able to regroup, for example if the brood is below half strength or the enemy is within 6” it still regroups. Note, however, that regrouping only takes place at the beginning of the turn so a Tyranid unit which falls back can be destroyed by pursuers or crossfire.<br>
In addition to these abilities a creature with the synapse power is able to cause all spore mines within 24” to detonate in the shooting phase. Note that this counts as the creature’s shooting attack for the turn, so it may not shoot or use other psychic powers in the shooting phase. Other creatures from the same unit may still fire at a different target if desired.<br>
The Horror:<br>
This power functions continuously and does not require a psychic test to use. Any enemy unit that wishes to assault a creature with this power must take a standard morale check. If the check is failed, the unit quails before the horrifying psychic presence of the Tyranid Hive Mind and may not make an assault that turn.<br>
Psychic Scream:<br>
This power functions continuously and does not require a psychic test to use. Any enemy units with models within 12” of a creature with this power suffer a -1 modifier to all Leadership based tests, including morale checks and pinning tests. If several creatures with the Psychic Scream power are within range of the unit, the modifiers are cumulative. Enemy psykers within range suffer the modifier to their leadership when testing to use psychic powers and any failed psychic test means they suffer an attack from the perils of the warp just as if they had rolled a 2 or 12.<br>
Catalyst:<br>
This power may be used once per turn at the beginning of the Tyranid players assault phase and requires a psychic test to use. If the test is successful the Tyranid player can nominate a single Tyranid unit within 18” of the creature using the power. Models in the affected unit will strike back in close combat even if they are killed before their turn to attack in the initiative order. The dead models are removed once they have made their attacks. The power only works for the duration of a single assault phase.<br>
Warp Blast:<br>
This power functions continuously and does not require a psychic test to use. The creature can attack in the shooting phase using a focused blast of warp energy. This counts as a weapon with the following characteristics. A standard roll to hit is needed for the creature to get the blast on target.<br>
Rng 24” Str 5 AP 3 Assault 1/blast<br>
Alternatively the creature can opt to tap into the energies of the hive mind to unleash a more focussed bolt. There is a risk of the coruscating power frying its brains so in order to use the high powered bolt the creature must take a psychic test. If the test is successful the blast uses the following stats.<br>
Rng 18” Str 10 AP2 Assault 1<br>
Warp field:<br>
This power functions continuously and does not require a psychic test to use. Defensive psychic barriers give the creature a 2+ armour save, note that this is not an invulnerable save as the mindshield can be overwhelmed by particularly potent weapons.<p>

&gt;TYRANID ARMY LIST
&gt;Bioweapons list
&gt;Last revised: 3/4/00
&gt;Tyranid Ranged Bioweapons
&gt;Tyranid ranged bioweapons are a part of their bodies, symbiote organisms melded to them from inception. To represent this their rate of fire and strength depend on the creature carrying them as detailed below. Bioweapons range and AP value characteristics are set by the type of weapon. A creature with two or more ranged bioweapons may only choose to fire one of them per shooting phase.
&gt;Strength: Ranged bioweapons have a Strength equal to the creature firing, modified as shown in the bioweapons profiles below. The toxins sacs biomorphs (+1 strength) does increase the strength of ranged bioweapons carried by the creature. Bio-weapons are limited to a maximum of strength 10.
&gt;Rate of Fire: Many bioweapons are Assault X weapons. These count as assault weapons get one shot per attack on the creatures basic profile (ie before modified by any other bioweapons), 2X weapons get twice the attacks in shots and so on.
&gt;For example a Gaunt (1 attack) with a Devourer (Assault 2X) fires 2 shots. A warrior (2 attacks) would fire four shots.
&gt;Ranged Bioweapon Symbiotes
&gt;Fleshborers: Despite its outward appearance of a more conventional gun, the Fleshborer is in fact a brood nest for sharp-fanged borer beetles. These are normally passive until a massive electro-chemical shock hurls them forth to expend their life energy frenziedly boring through armour, flesh and bone. 
&gt;Rng	Str	AP	Type:	
&gt;12”	As creature +1	-	Assault X	
&gt;Spinefists: A Spinefist is a symbiote weapon-creature carried by Tyranids for close quarter fighting. The Spinefist launches a salvo of diamond-hard spines coated with a lethal neuro-toxin in a broad pattern when stimulated. 
&gt;Rng	Str	AP	Type:	
&gt;12”	As creature	5	Assault X	
&gt;Devourers: The aptly named Devourer is a conical lump of flesh infested by writhing worm-like organisms with black, shiny heads. When the weapon is triggered a bio-electrical jolt hurls a shower of flesh-worms at the target which immediately start burrowing inside the victim's body. A creature infested by flesh-worms is driven mad with agony as the worms eat their way through its nervous system to the brain and devour it. 
&gt;Rng	Str	AP	Type:	
&gt;12”	As creature -1	6	Assault 2X	
&gt;Death spitters: Death Spitters are complex multi-creature symbiotes which launch a highly corrosive maggot-like organism with a powerful muscle spasm. Wherever the creature strikes gobbets of volatile fluid are splattered across a wide area, searing exposed flesh and melting through armour with equal vigour. 
&gt;Rng	Str	AP	Type:	
&gt;18”	As creature +1	5	Assault 1/blast	
&gt;Barbed Stranglers: The barbed strangler is a seed fired from a simple launcher which is little more than a muscled tube. The strangler seed-pod grows to maturity in seconds, spreading and growing in all direction with blinding speed, sending out hooked tendrils to bind and then tear apart its prey. Studies of the creature have revealed it to be plant-like with similarities to some terrestrial xeromorphs. 
&gt;Rng	Str	AP	Type:	
&gt;24”	As creature -2	-	Assault 1/ord. blast	
&gt;Venom cannon: The Venom cannon is a long, powerful bio-weapon which fires salvoes of highly corrosive poison crystals encrusted with a metallic residue. The symbiote fires using an electro-static charge to accelerate its deadly ammunition to supersonic speeds. A target struck by the Venom cannon is either killed by the impact and blast of electrical energy or by corrosive fragments from the poison crystals when they shatter. Even vehicle armour can be penetrated by the crystals, leading to poisoned crew members and shattered equipment, although the lack of explosive impact reduces lethality. 
&gt;Rng	Str	AP	Type:	
&gt;36”	As creature +2	4	Assault X	
&gt;Note: Venom cannon can only achieve glancing hits against vehicles, count any penetrating hits as glancing hits instead.
&gt;Close Combat Symbiotes
&gt;All close combat symbiotes count as special close combat attacks and are therefore only effective if the Tyranid model is in base to base combat or within 2” and has the leaping special rule. However, a Tyranid creature can use all of its close combat symbiotes in an assault and is not only limited to using one at a time like most models.
&gt;Scything Talons: Many Tyranid creatures have long stabbing and slashing claws of razor-edged bone or chitin. The reach and sweep of such talons enables them attack murderously at close quarters, eviscerating their victims with a flurry of blows.
&gt;Tyranid creatures with scything talons count as having two close combat weapons in an assault and so gain +1 attack. Creatures with two sets of Scything talons gain +2 attacks in close combat instead of +1. No more than +2 attacks can be gained and the number of shots with Assault X weapons is not increased by scything talons. Note that this is the only way that Tyranids gain extra attacks in close combat for multiple weapons, their number of limbs is accounted for in their basic profiles.
&gt;Rending claws: Rending claws are short and powerful, tipped with diamond-hard spikes or talons. They are quite capable of crushing plasteel and ripping through the thickest armour with their vice-like grip.
&gt;Tyranid creatures with rending claws will inflict a wound automatically and ignore armour saves just like a power weapon with close combat attacks which roll a 6 to hit. Other attacks which hit on a roll other than 6 must roll to wound as normal and the victim receives their normal armour saving throw.
&gt;If a creature with rending claws rolls a 6 for its armour penetration dice roll against a vehicle it rolls another D6 and adds the result to the total armour penetration score. For example a Tyranid Warrior hits a vehicle in close combat. The Tyranid player gets lucky and rolls a 6 for armour penetration, so he rolls the dice again and gets a 4, giving him an armour penetration score of 5 (the Warriors Strength) + 6 +4 = 15
&gt;Lash Whips : Lash whips are living ropes of muscle and sinew which writhe and twist with a will of their own. In combat they strangle and bind, entangling creatures so that they are easy meat for the Tyranids.
&gt;Enemy models in base contact with creatures equipped with lash whips reduce their number of attacks by one, to a minimum of one. Lash whips may not be used by creatures who are 2” away and using the Leaping special to count their full number of attacks.
&gt;Biomorph enhancements
&gt;Biomorph enhancements are grafted or bio-engineered combat modifications which are appended to the beast’s throat, chest, tail etc. These enhance the creature in combat without inhibiting its ability to carry and use other weapon-symbiotes.
&gt;Implant Attack: Identifiable as a barbed stinger attached to a tail or tongue, implant attacks usually deliver corrosive pathogens, parasitic infections, organic acids or lethal toxins. Survivors of such attacks are rare.
&gt;A model which fails its saving throw when wounded by a creature with an Implant attack suffers two wounds instead of one.
&gt;Flesh hooks: Flesh hooks are formed out of carbon-based chitin with a monomolecular edge attached to lengths of exceptionally tough muscle fibre situated between a creatures ribs. The hooks are fired by a sharp intercostal muscle spasm, shooting out to allow the creature to snare their victims from a distance. The flesh hooks are also sometimes used as grapnels to allow creatures to scale vertical surfaces at great speed.
&gt;A creature with flesh hooks counts as being equipped with frag grenades in close combat. In addition, creatures with flesh hooks count ‘vertically impassable’ pieces of terrain such as high walls or cliffs as difficult terrain.
&gt;Bio Plasma: Some Tyranid creatures have the capacity to internally energise a form of bio-plasma which they vomit forth as a ball or bolt of blinding green fire. The plasmic material is held in their gut and energised by rasping plates in their oesophagus, this process makes a high-pitched screaming which precedes a bio-plasma attack.
&gt;Creatures with bio plasma can make a single extra close combat attack, worked out at double the models Intiative (ie Intiative 8 for a Gargoyle, 4 for a Carnifex). Bio plasma can be used by models within 2” of the enemy as well as by models in base contact. The bio plasma hits on a roll of 4+ on a D6 regardless of the target type or WS. It inflicts a single hit with a Strength equal to the creature +1 (to a maximum of S10), normal armour saves are allowed. Remove models as you would other close combat casualties.
&gt;Once bio plasma attacks have been resolved creatures make their other close combat attacks at their normal Intiative value. Note that since bio plasma kills count as close combat casualties a creature who starts the combat in base contact will get its full number of attacks (including benefits from close combat bioweapons), even if the model they are in base contact with is removed by bio plasma.

&gt;SPECIAL RULES
&gt;Tyranid Monstrous Creature: The Hive Tyrant is Tyranid monstrous creature and follows the special rules detailed on pxx.
&gt;Mutable: The characteristics and weaponry of Hive Tyrants can be substantially altered by using the bio-genetic modification procedure detailed later.
&gt;Tyrant’s Bodyguard: The Hive Tyrant may be accompanied by bodyguard of specially bio-constructed Tyranid Warriors. The tyrant’s guard do not count as a separate HQ choice. However a second brood of Tyrant Guards can be chosen as a second HQ choice if desired.
&gt;Tyrant Guard Brood ***Genofixed Species ***45pts/model 
&gt;	WS	BS	S	T	W	I	A	Ld	Sv	
&gt;Tyrant Guard	5	3	5	6	2	5	2	10	3+	
&gt;Brood: The brood consists of between 2 and 3 Tyrant Guards.
&gt;Bio Weapons: Lash whips, rending claws and spine shield (counts as spinefists)
&gt;Options: The Tyrant Guard brood may be equipped with up to two biomorph enhancements chosen from the following list at the points cost indicated.
&gt;Flesh Hooks 1 pts
&gt;Implant attack 6 pts
&gt;ELITES
&gt;0-1 Lictors ***Genofixed Species *** 80 pts each 
&gt;	WS	BS	S	T	W	I	A	Ld	Sv	
&gt;Lictor	6	-	6	4	3	6	2+1	10	5+	
&gt;Brood: You may include between 1 and 3 Lictors as a single Elites choice, but only one choice may be made per army, thus you have a maximum of three in an army. Lictors are deployed as a single unit but do not need to be placed together and operate independently during the game.
&gt;Bio Weapons: Lictors are armed with Scything talons, rending claws and Flesh Hooks
&gt;SPECIAL RULES
&gt;Secret Deployment: Before either side deploys their armies at the start of a battle the Tyranid player may deploy any of their Lictors secretly to represent them creeping into position. Lictors may only be secretly deployed in areas of cover which are outside the enemies’ deployment zone. Write down which Lictors are secretly deploying and exactly where they are (note if you are using the junglefight rules from Codex: Catachan simply treat Lictors as units that can use the ambush rules).
&gt;The Tyranid player can reveal the location of a Lictor at the start of any Tyranid Shooting phase and place the model on the tabletop. Once the Lictor has been placed on the tabletop it is allowed to move, assault and fight normally.
&gt;The opposing player can use units to reveal hidden Lictors by searching for them. A unit can declare it is searching at the start of the shooting phase, roll a D6 for it and on a 6 any Lictor(s) within 6” of the squad are revealed and placed on the tabletop immediately. Add +2 to the roll if the unit is armed with a weapon which uses a template (such as a flamer) as these are ideal for flushing out cover. If the unit contains a psyker or a model equipped with an auspex or scanner that model may not shoot while searching but Lictors within 6” are revealed automatically. A searching unit may still fire or move using fleet of foot in the shooting phase.
&gt;Stealth: The Lictors’ chameleonic scales make it an extremely difficult target. A Lictor always receives a 5+ cover save even in the open. If the Lictor is actually in cover its cover saving throw is improved by +2, so for example it would receive a 3+ cover save in woods or jungles. A Lictor gains no benefits from its stealth while in close combat, reverting to its natural 5+ armour save for its chitinous armour. Sentries killed by a Lictor in close combat will only raise the alarm on a D6 roll of 6 instead or 4 or more.
&gt;Fearless: Lictors are driven by the implacable alien will of the Hive mind. A Lictor never has to fall back and is assumed to automatically pass any morale checks it is required to take, even against attacks which normally force their target to fall back with no test taken. Lictors cannot be pinned.
&gt;Hit and Run: Lictors may choose to leave close combat. Declare this at the end of any close combat phase, after all morale checks have been taken. The Lictor immediately falls back 3D6” and regroups at the end of its move. Enemy models may not pursue the Lictor but may consolidate.
&gt;Independent Character: You may include between 1 and 3 Lictors as a single Elites choice. Lictors operate independently and so follow the rules for independent characters given on p74 of the Warhammer 40,000 rulebook. However Lictors can never join another unit and they always fight individually. Note that for the purposes of mission objectives Lictors cannot capture table quarters, hold objectives or count as surviving troops in a meat grinder battle.

Rippers cannot be pinned. For the purposes of mission objectives Ripper swarms cannot capture table quarters, hold objectives or count as surviving troops in a meat grinder battle.
&gt;Vulnerable to blasts: Temple and blast marker weapons inflict two wounds instead of one on Ripper swarms.
&gt;Small targets: Ripper swarms in cover are extremely hard to hit so their cover save is improved by +1.
&gt;Mutable Genus: The characteristics and weaponry of Ripper swarms can be substantially altered by using the bio-genetic modification procedure detailed later.

&gt;Bio Weapons: Scything talons.
&gt;SPECIAL RULES
&gt;Bounding Leap: Hormagaunts move 6” like other troops, however in the assault phase they may assault up to 12” (or double the distance of the dice roll if they move through difficult terrain). Hormagaunts advance and fall back 3D6”. In addition Hormagaunts count their full number of attacks in close combat if they are within 2” of an enemy model. Remember that when charging models must move into base to base contact with the enemy if they can reach them.
&gt;Fleet of claw: Hormagaunts can race along extremely quickly by using all six limbs for locomotion. To represent this Hormagaunt broods can move another D6” in the shooting phase, ignoring penalties for difficult terrain.

&gt;Gargoyle	3	3	3	3	1	4	1	10	6+	
&gt;Brood: The Brood consists of between 8 and 32 Gargoyles.
&gt;Bio Weapons: Fleshborer and bio plasma attack
&gt;SPECIAL RULES
&gt;Wings: Gargoyles' wings allow them to move 12” in the movement phase and they advance or fallback 3D6” instead of 2D6”. Gargoyles ignore terrain moved over but may not enter difficult or impassable terrain due to their vulnerable wing membranes. Gargoyles forced to enter difficult or impassable terrain for any reason are removed as casualties.
&gt;Fleet of wing: Gargoyles can fly faster if they don’t shoot. To represent this Gargoyles broods can move another D6” in the shooting phase if they do not shoot.
&gt;Deep Strike: In the right circumstances Gargoyles can swoop down into battle, appearing almost anywhere on the battlefield. To represent this they may set up using the Deep Strike rules, but only if the mission allows for Deep Strike to be used. If the mission does not allow units to use the Deep Strike rules then the Gargoyles must set up normally with the rest of the army.
&gt;HEAVY SUPPORT

&gt;Venom Cannon 45 pts 
&gt;Barbed Strangler 35 pts 
&gt;Scything Talons 8 pts 
&gt;Rending claws 2 pts 
&gt;In addition a Carnifex may be equipped with up to two bioweapons chosen from the following list at the points cost indicated. 
&gt;Flesh Hooks 2 pts 
&gt;Bio plasma attack 15 pts 
&gt;SPECIAL RULES
&gt;Tyranid Monstrous Creature: The Carnifex is a Tyranid monstrous creature and follows the special rules detailed on pxx.
&gt;Mutable Genus: The characteristics and weaponry of Carnifexes can be substantially altered by using the bio-genetic modification procedure detailed later.
&gt;0-1 Biovores ***Genofixed Species *** 40 pts each 
&gt;	WS	BS	S	T	W	I	A	Ld	Sv	
&gt;Biovore	3	3	3	4	2	1	1	10	-	
&gt;Spore mine	0	0	1	4	1	1	0	10	-	
&gt;Brood: You may include between 1 and 3 Biovore as a single Heavy Support choice, but only one choice may be made per army, thus you have a maximum of three in an army. Biovore are deployed as a single unit but do not need to be placed together and operate independently during the game.
&gt;Bio Weapons: Biovores store and fire spore mines as their main weapons, defending themselves with tooth and claw if attacked. The spore mines available to each Biovore must be chosen from the following list at the points costs indicated. A Biovore carries enough spore mines of the types chosen to last the entire battle.
&gt;Poison 12 pts
&gt;Area of effect: Ordnance blast marker. Str special AP 4
&gt;Poison mines always count as having a Strength equal to the targets Toughness. Therefore poison mines will normally wound on a D6 roll of 4 or more. Poison mines can only affect vehicles which are open-topped, but against open topped vehicles they inflict a single glancing hit automatically.
&gt;Frag 10 pts.
&gt;Area of effect: Ordnance blast marker. Str 4 AP 5
&gt;Bio Acid. 16 pts
&gt;Blast Marker: Flamer template. Str 3 AP 3
&gt;Place the narrow end of the template in contact with the spore mine model and use the scatter dice to determine which direction the template is placed in, on a roll of a ‘hit’ the template is pointed towards the nearest enemy model. Acid spore mines roll 2D6 to penetrate vehicle armour.
&gt;SPECIAL RULES
&gt;Spore Mine: The Biovore works by firing a deadly living bomb, called a Spore Mine, towards the enemy. To fire the Biovore, place a Spore Mine model anywhere on the table to indicate the firing direction. Then make a range guess of up to 48” in much the same way as a barrage weapon (p58 of the Warhammer 40,000 rulebook) and move the spore mine to that distance from the Biovore in the direction indicated. Roll the Scatter dice and 2D6 and reposition the Spore Mine accordingly to determine the landing point of the mine. If a hit is rolled then the Spore Mine is bang on target and doesn’t scatter. Note that a line of sight is not needed to the target spot, and that Spore Mines do not cause pinning. Multiple Biovores do not form barrages, work out each shot separately.
&gt;Once launched Spore mines follow the rules given in the Spore Mine rules on pXX. 
&gt;	Range	Strength	AP	Type	
&gt;Biovore	G48	Varies	Varies	Heavy 1	
&gt;Living Artillery: For the purposes of mission objectives Biovores cannot capture table quarters, hold objectives or count as surviving troops in a meat grinder battle.

&gt;	WS	BS	S	T	W	I	A	Ld	Sv	
&gt;Zoanthrope	3	3	4	4	2	4	2	10	2+	
&gt;Brood: You may include between 1 and 3 Zoanthropes as a single Heavy Support choice, but only one choice may be made per army, thus you have a maximum of three in an army. Zoanthropes are deployed as a single unit but do not need to be placed together and operate independently during the game.
&gt;Bio Weapons: Zoanthropes have nothing but their basic claws and teeth (and awesome psychic powers) to fight with.
&gt;Hive Mind powers
&gt;Zoanthropes always have the following psychic power.

&gt;THE TYRANID HIVE SPECIAL RULES
&gt;The Hive Mind and Synapse Creatures
&gt;All Tyranids are united by the potent psychic imperatives of their shared Hive Mind. Some of the larger, more intelligent Tyranid creatures have vastly expanded synapse networks within their cortex that act as a psychic conduit for the directives of the Hive Mind, over-ruling the natural instincts of nearby Tyranid creatures.
&gt;Any Tyranid unit with a model within 12” of a creature with synapse hive mind power (including the creature itself) ignores any Morale and pinning checks and automatically passes tests to regroup it is required to make. Note that regrouping only takes place at the beginning of the turn so a Tyranid unit which falls back can be destroyed by pursuers or crossfire.
&gt;Tyranid Instinctive behaviour
&gt;Beyond the immediate reach of the Hive Mind lesser Tyranid creatures will often revert to their basic, often animalistic instincts. To represent this at the beginning of the Tyranid turn any broods or outside synapse control range must take a morale check for being ‘All on your own’ (this being the equivalent situation for Tyranids), if the test is failed roll for the brood reaction on the Instinctive behaviour table below.
&gt;Likewise Tyranid creatures which fail a morale check or pinning test while beyond the range of a creature with the synapse power will revert to their basic instincts. Roll on the table below to see how a Tyranid unit responds to failed pinning or morale checks when out of range of any synapse creatures.
&gt;Tyranid Instinctive behaviour table 
&gt;D6 roll	Morale Check	Pinning Test	
&gt;1-2	Fall back	Pinned	
&gt;3-4	Lurk	Lurk	
&gt;5-6	Attack!	Attack!	
&gt;Fall back: The brood will start to falling back towards the nearest model with the Synapse Creature Hive Mind Power. If none are on the tabletop the brood will fall back towards the Tyranid players table edge.
&gt;Pinned: The brood is pinned as per the normal rules.
&gt;Lurk: The brood will start falling back towards the nearest terrain which will give them a cover save and is not closer to the enemy.
&gt;Attack!: The brood snarls, bellows and hisses in a terrifying fashion and charges towards their attackers. Move the unit 2D6” towards the nearest enemy unit, if it makes contact with enemy models count this move as a sweeping advance. If the Tyranid unit is already in an assault fight another round of close combat immediately.
&gt;Fast and Deadly
&gt;Tyranid swarms move quickly across even the most inhospitable and broken ground under the mental lash of the hive mind. In battle Tyranids attack at the run and often creatures are trampled, forced over cliffs or drowned by the animalistic stampede as the swarms race forward. To represent this Tyranid creatures always roll one D6 more than normal when checking to see how far they can move through difficult ground (ie three D6 instead of two D6 in jungles and so on). However if a Tyranid brood of eight or more models rolls two or more 6’s on the dice it suffers one wound in the stampede, saving throws apply as normal. Synapse creatures still get to roll an extra dice but will not suffer wounds when moving through difficult ground due to their control of the creatures around them.
&gt;Tyranid Monstrous Creatures
&gt;Tyranid monstrous creatures combine some of the abilities of both independent characters and monstrous creatures. As such the following rules apply;
&gt;Tyranid monstrous creatures can join units of other Tyranid creatures, but they may always be picked out as a separate target for enemy shooting unless the unit is of Tyrant Guards. A Tyranid unit including a Tyranid monstrous creature is limited to moving and assaulting at the speed of the slowest model in the unit.
&gt;Tyranid monstrous creatures are fearless. They never have to fall back and are assumed to automatically pass any morale checks they are required to take, even against attacks which normally force their target to fall back with no test taken. Tyranid monstrous creatures cannot be pinned.
&gt;Tyranid monstrous creatures can always choose to allocate their close combat attacks to enemy models in base to base contact with them or choose to shoot at a different target to the unit they have joined.
&gt;Tyranid monstrous creatures may reroll the dice for moving through difficult terrain unless they have joined a unit.
&gt;Tyranid monstrous creatures ignore enemy armour saves in close combat and roll 2D6 for armour penetration against vehicles in close combat.
&gt;Tyranid monstrous creatures count as a unit of troops for victory conditions so they can capture table quarters, hold objectives or count as surviving troops in a meat grinder battle.
&gt;“Shoot the big ones”
&gt;Enemies of the Tyranids have learned many valuable lessons at a terrible cost in lives lost and blood shed. One of the most important stratagems has been teaching troops to pick the right targets from the swarm even in the heat of battle. Because of this an opposing player can freely choose to direct fire from his units at any Tyranid brood or creature within range in the shooting phase, line of fire is only blocked by terrain and vehicles.
&gt;Spore Mines
&gt;Spore Mines are very basic, geno-modified organisms which the Tyranids use as ‘living bombs’ most commonly launched from living artillery pieces called biovores. The mines are engorged sacs full of chemicals, viruses, toxins and poisons which drift slowly in the air currents, with nests of sensitive feelers dangling below questing for the heat and vibration which attracts them to their target. Although it is possible to still avoid the attention of a spore mine by moving carefully quietly, weapons discharges and other violent noises will stimulate a detonation with often fatal results.
&gt;Due to their unique nature and mode of attack spore mines use a number of special rules.
&gt;Movement: Spore Mines drift D6” in a random direction in each Tyranid movement phase, determined by rolling the scatter dice. On a roll of a ‘hit’ symbol on the scatter dice the Tyranid player may choose the direction of movement. Unlike most models a Spore Mine can move within 1” of enemy models and vehicles during its movement. Spore Mines cannot make assault moves.
&gt;Detonation: If an enemy unit or vehicle shoots while there is a spore mine within 1” then the mine explodes. Resolve the detonation once the unit or vehicles’ firing has been completed. Place the appropriate template or markers over the spot where the spore mine explodes and resolve the results according to its type as described in the Tyranid army list. If a Spore Mine is reduced to zero wounds or otherwise killed, it will explode as detailed above. An enemy unit may treat all spore mine models within 6” of its members as a single target for shooting purposes. Spore mines can also be detonated by synaptic control, see the Tyranid Hive Mind Powers for details.
&gt;Morale: Being essentially mindless a Spore Mine never has to fall back and is assumed to automatically pass any morale checks it is required to take, even against attacks which normally force their target to fall back with no test taken. Spore Mines cannot be pinned. For the purposes of mission objectives Spore Mines cannot capture table quarters, hold objectives or count as surviving troops in a meat grinder battle.
&gt;Preliminary Barrage: Clusters of Spore Mines are often scattered over an area in tens of thousands as a kind of Tyranid preliminary bombardment, drifting down from the air currents when attracted by weapons fire. To represent this the Tyranid preliminary barrage scenario special rule (p135) is modified as follows. Only roll to hit units, not obstacles. Any units which are ‘hit’ on a roll of 6 have attracted D3 spore mines. The Tyranid player places these within 1” of the unit and then rolls the scatter dice for each and moves it 2D6” in the direction indicated. Roll a D6 to randomly to determine what kinds of spore mine appear: 1-2 Frag 3-4 Poison 5-6 Bio-acid.
&gt;Tyranid Hive Mind powers
&gt;Many Tyranid organisms exhibit psychic powers because they act as a conduit for the awesome energies of the Hive Mind. Any Tyranid creature with these powers is considered to be a psyker so will, for example, be vulnerable to the Dark Eldar Crucible of Malediction. Hive mind powers do not require a psychic test to use unless specifically stated in their description. Only those powers which require a psychic test to use may be cancelled by enemy psykers.
&gt;Synapse Creature:
&gt;This power functions continuously and does not require a psychic test to use. Any Tyranid unit with a model within 12” of a creature with this power, including the creature itself, ignore any Morale checks, pinning tests and automatically pass tests to regroup. Synapse dominated regrouping ignores the usual restrictions for not being able to regroup, for example if the brood is below half strength or the enemy is within 6” it still regroups. Note, however, that regrouping only takes place at the beginning of the turn so a Tyranid unit which falls back can be destroyed by pursuers or crossfire.
&gt;In addition to these abilities a creature with the synapse power is able to cause all spore mines within 24” to detonate in the shooting phase. Note that this counts as the creature’s shooting attack for the turn, so it may not shoot or use other psychic powers in the shooting phase. Other creatures from the same unit may still fire at a different target if desired.
&gt;The Horror:
&gt;This power functions continuously and does not require a psychic test to use. Any enemy unit that wishes to assault a creature with this power must take a standard morale check. If the check is failed, the unit quails before the horrifying psychic presence of the Tyranid Hive Mind and may not make an assault that turn.
&gt;Psychic Scream:
&gt;This power functions continuously and does not require a psychic test to use. Any enemy units with models within 12” of a creature with this power suffer a -1 modifier to all Leadership based tests, including morale checks and pinning tests. If several creatures with the Psychic Scream power are within range of the unit, the modifiers are cumulative. Enemy psykers within range suffer the modifier to their leadership when testing to use psychic powers and any failed psychic test means they suffer an attack from the perils of the warp just as if they had rolled a 2 or 12.
&gt;Catalyst:
&gt;This power may be used once per turn at the beginning of the Tyranid players assault phase and requires a psychic test to use. If the test is successful the Tyranid player can nominate a single Tyranid unit within 18” of the creature using the power. Models in the affected unit will strike back in close combat even if they are killed before their turn to attack in the initiative order. The dead models are removed once they have made their attacks. The power only works for the duration of a single assault phase.
&gt;Warp Blast:
&gt;This power functions continuously and does not require a psychic test to use. The creature can attack in the shooting phase using a focused blast of warp energy. This counts as a weapon with the following characteristics. A standard roll to hit is needed for the creature to get the blast on target.
&gt;Rng 24” Str 5 AP 3 Assault 1/blast
&gt;Alternatively the creature can opt to tap into the energies of the hive mind to unleash a more focussed bolt. There is a risk of the coruscating power frying its brains so in order to use the high powered bolt the creature must take a psychic test. If the test is successful the blast uses the following stats.
&gt;Rng 18” Str 10 AP2 Assault 1
&gt;Warp field:
&gt;This power functions continuously and does not require a psychic test to use. Defensive psychic barriers give the creature a 2+ armour save, note that this is not an invulnerable save as the mindshield can be overwhelmed by particularly potent weapons.
