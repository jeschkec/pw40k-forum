"The Emperor's Scythes (A.K.A. 'Scythes of the Emperor') are a Chapter that was based on the Eastern Fringe until the invasion by Hive Fleet Kraken. During the invasion, they gathered intelligence on the Tyranids and destroyed thousands of them by boarding their craft just after they exited the Warp, while the creatures were still dormant. Along with the Ultramarines and Lamentors, they defended the systems of the Eastern Fringe and were instrumental in the destruction of the Tyranid Fleet; although this Chapter along with the Lamentors, suffered extremely heavy losses."<p>

 Founding<br>
Legiones Astartes Chapter 874 [The Scythes of the Emperor] was founded in the years following The Badab war (Rebellion led by the Tiger Claws Chapter - M40.901). Genestock is speculated to have been that of none other than the Ultramarines of the Ultramar Empire.<p>
<br>
Their primary mission was the enforcement of the Emperor's will on the Eastern Fringe of the Imperium, their secondary mission however,was to watch the recently forgiven Lamenters Chapter(Recently returned after performing a century long penance crusade starting M40.907) for any further signs of revolt after that Chapter's involvement in The Badab War around M40.903 with the Fire Hawks and Excutioners chapters.<br>
 <br>
The Arrival of Hive Fleet Behemoth (M40.741 - 745)<p>
The Scythes of the Emperor had little involvement in containing the first Tyranid invasion. The chapter sent a few squads to the Ultramar empire but spent the majority of that war fortifying their homeworld of Sotha for a possible attack on Sotha. Elements of the chapter were also deployed to combat an Ork migration that was passing though the Graia system.<p>
The Arrival of Hive Fleet Kraken (M40.992)<p>
The Imperial Tarot began to tell of disaster 10 years before the arrival of Hive Fleet Kraken. Images of disaster haunted the chapter master and the astopaths. An uprising on the Factory World of Graia led to the deployment of the 3rd, 9th, and elements of the 10th companies to restore the Imperium's hold on the system. During the Scythes invasion it became apparent that the uprising was caused by a Genestealer cult. After several months of combat and heavy causalities, the cult was finally crushed.<br>
While returning home the Scythes forces encountered disturbances in the warp. The navigators decided to stop in the Miral System to wait out the warp storms. Their the forces returning from Graia encountered the remnents of their own chapter, and learned of the overrunning of Sotha & destruction of the Lamenters (The Lamenters made their last defense against the Tyranids at the Devlan System Sentinel Stations) by what the Imperium had now code named Hive Fleet Kraken. The Scythes organized the Miral PDF to defend against what seemed to be an imminent assault.<br>
Within a week the Tyranid were upon them. The Imperial forces chose a large rock mesa known as the Giant's Coffin. After several weeks of fighting the imperial forces attempted a breakout to try and leave the planet utilising a recently discovered Titan in the counter-attack. Barely a hundred troops escaped Miral. The survivors fled back to Graia to organize the defenders. <br>
On Graia the the final stand was made, It was here the Tyranid Sub-fleet advance was stopped, and the Crusade for their vengence began." <p>
