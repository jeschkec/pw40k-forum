Als Antwort auf: <a href="14909.htm">Gibt es für die Necrons eiinen Codex?</a> geschrieben von Beni am 05. November 2000 13:22:23:<p>
Okay, ich habe hier mal den inoffiziellen Necrons Codex abgebildet, den ich mal irgendwo aufgetrieben habe.<p>
Er ist zwar in Englisch, aber ich glaube, dass ist weniger schlimm<p>
----------------------------------------------------------------------<p>
Necrons<p>
Note: Includes WD 239 update.<p>
Necrons Army List<br>
The Necrons are a biologically dead race that was wiped out in a galaxy wide catastrophe approximately 60 million years ago.  Faced with extinction the Necrons constructed metal bodies as repositories for their hyper-advanced minds.  To weather the impending galactic bio-meltdown the Necrons constructed huge stasis chambers to shelter inside.  They have been there ever since, resting until such time that the galaxy was safe for them to emerge.<br>
See WD 217 and 218 for more background.<br>
Special Rules<br>
1. Necron Weapons<br>
Necrons have four different kinds of Gauss weapon: the Gauss Gun carried by Necron Warriors, larger Gauss Blasters carried by Necron Immortals and the Heavy Gauss Cannon, mounted on Necron Destroyers.  The fourth type of Gauss weapon is the Gauss Grenade.   Unlike most other weapons, Gauss weapons have the ability to 'flay' chunks of metal from even the most heavily armoured vehicles and this gives them a certain amount of penetrating power beyond what might be expected.  To represent this a hit on a vehicle will always score a Glancing Hit on the score of a 6, even if the target's armour value is greater than could normally be penetrated. <br>
Necron Lords carry a Staff of Light - a mysterious short ranged weapon. <br>
Gauss Grenades are used in assaults against vehicles.  Any hit inflicted on the target by a unit equipped with Gauss Grenades will score a Glancing Hit on a D6 roll of a 6 regardless of the vehicle's armour value.  However, as with Krak Grenades and Melta Bombs, only 1 attack can be made per model.  No bonus attacks are added from anything.<br>
2.  Morale<br>
Necrons do have to take Morale Checks normally, but a broken Necron Squad that is assaulted will automatically regroup - the Necrons consider their withdrawl in the light of the immediate danger.  This also applies if the enemy advances after the Necron unit after breaking them in an assault - the broken Necrons regroup at the end of their Fall Back move, just like Space Marines.  Note that Necrons can still be killed by crossfire.  They will not be actually destroyed, but will use their internal teleporters to remove themselves from the battlefield before they sustain serious damage.<br>
3.  25% Phase Out<br>
Although Necrons are not affected by panic or disaffection, being for the most part mechanical, they can still recognise a hopeless situation.  Once the number of functioning Necron models is down to 25% or less of the original size of the force, the remainder will automatically phase out using their internal teleporters.  This is the only way to drive away a Necron force - destroy at least 75% of them!<br>
4.  We'll Be Back<br>
If a Necron Warrior, Immortal or Character model should be killed, do not remove it from the tabletop, but lay the model down instead.  The model is out of action but, being a Necron, may get a chance to come back.  At the start of the Necron player's turn, roll a die for each out of action Warrior or Immortal that is within 6" of at least one other 'living' Necron model of the same type.  If there are any out of action Warriors or Immortals that are not within 6", they will automatically phase out - remove them from the battlefield.  The Necron player can also roll a die on behalf of a Lord that is out of action, regardless of whether there are other Necrons near him or not.  Necron models hit by a weapon that autokills (weapons with a Strength that is twice the Necron's Toughness) are totally annihilated and are removed straight away - there is no chance of self-repair.<br>
Score	Result<br>
1-3	Necron is beyond repair.  Model phases out from the battlefield and disapears. Remove the model as a casualty.<br>
4-6	Necron rises to its feet to carry on fighting.  It will move immediatly to join the closest unit of the same type, if it is a Warrior or Immortal.  Once the Necron has joined the unit (is within 2" of another unit member), the Necron moves and fights with it - any movement it may have already made is disregarded.<br>

Special Rules:  Independant Character<br>
Necron Lord Wargear:<br>
A Necron Lord may be upgraded to include one of the options shown below, at the points cost indicated.<br>
Gaze of Flame -15pts<br>
Models which charge into combat with the Necron Lord gain no bonus to their attacks for charging as they are inexplicably slowed at the last instant (yes, even tyranids, Daemons and other things who think they should be immune are effected). Units fighting an assault involving a Necron Lord with the Gaze of Flame suffer a -2 Leadership penalty in addition to any other modifiers.<br>
Scourge of Light - 15pts<br>
The Necron Lord counts as being armed with a power weapon.<br>
Veil of Darkness - 50pts.<br>
A Necron Lord can opt to use the Veil of Darkness at the beginning of is movement phase instead of moving normally. The Necron Lord and up to one unit of Necrons within 6" of him are removed from the tabletop and are then immediately placed anywhere on the tabletop using the Deep Strike scenario special rule. The Veil of Darkness may b used even if enemy models are in base contact with the Necron Lord or any of the Necrons he moves with him (the enemy models are left behind)<br>

Necron Immortals - 28 points each<br>
Necron Immortals are heavily armoured, extremely tough Necrons, who carry the terrifying Gauss Blaster weapon.<br>

Weapons:  Gauss Cannon<br>
Options:  Up to one Destroyer per squad may upgrade its Gauss Cannon to a Heavy Gauss Cannon at +10 points.  Range 36", S9, AP3, Heavy 1.   All the normal Gauss rules apply.<br>
Special Rules:  Destroyers are the equivalent of Jet Bikes and follow all the normal rules.  If a Destroyer goes out of action, it cannot return.   However, its rider may make the roll, so long as he is within 6" of a Necron Warrior unit.  Otherwise, follow the I'll Be Back Rules as normal.<br>
 <br>
Scarabs - 6 points each<br>
Necron Raids include large numbers of small bettle-like robots, dubbed Scarabs by the Imperial Guard.  These Scarabs latch themselves onto enemy machines before self destructing in spectacular explosions.<br>
  WS     BS      S     T    W     I     A    Ld   Sv<br>

Squad:  5-10 Scarabs<br>
Scarabs:  Scarabs move and fight in the same way as jetbikes, though they do not get a +1 Toughness bonus. <br>
Destruct: Instead of attacking in close combat, a Scarab can self destruct instead.  This causes one automatic hit on each target in base contact at Strength 3 an AP2.  Against vehicles this causes 3+2D6 Penetration.  The Scarab is destroyed by this and cannot save or roll to repair.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
NECRON ATTACK<br>
Necron Scenarios<br>
When fighting against necrons, use the following Force Organisation charts and Mission Generator.  These represent surprise attacks by Necrons, enemy forces stumbling on a Necron stasis chamber or the Necron's enemies making a concentrated effort to capture or destroy a Necron base.<br>
Necron Force<br>
Note that the Necrons do not hace any Heavy Support units at the moment, but they may be added at a later date.<br>
Compulsory - 1 HQ, 2 Troops<br>
Optional - 1 more HQ, 4 more Troops, 2 Heavy Support, 3 Elites, 3 Fast Attack<br>
Enemy Force<br>
As you can see below, the Necrons' foes do not have access to many specialised units - the Necrons are often found on very isolated worlds by small scouting forces and there have been no reports of them engaging in large scale battles with a numerous foe.<br>
Compulsory - 1 Troops<br>
Optional - 1 HQ, 5 more Troops, 2 Heavy Support, 1 Elite, 2 Fast Attack<br>
Terrain<br>
Set up the terrain in any mutually agreeable manner, taking into account any special features due to the mission being fought<br>
Selecting a Mission<br>
1  Breakout - Necrons are the Defenders<br>
2  Night Fight<br>
3  Rescue<br>
4  Ambush - Necrons are always the Attacker, even against Dark Eldar<br>
5 - Strongpoint Assault - Use Strategy Ratings to determine the Attacker.  The Necrons have a Strategy Rating of D3.<br>
6  Meatgrinder - Necrons are always the Attacker, even against Dark Eldar<br>
Using your Necrons in unarranged games<br>
You may just turn up at a club or shop with your Necron army and find your opponent's army does not fit in with the Force Organisation.  In this case, these excess units are held in Reserve, following the normal rules and they will arrive in the owning player's deployment zone.  If the mission generated already allows for Reserves, these units will suffer a -1 modifier when rolling to see if they arrive.<p>
