Hallo ihr da draussen. <br>
Ich hab mir ein paar Gedanken zu den Night Lords gemacht und will jetzt ein paar ehrliche Meinungen zu den folgenden Regeln haben.<br>
Ich hab mir Überlegt eine Armee zu schaffen die den Hintergrundgeschichten aus der 2nd ED entspricht.<br>
Da ich so ziemlich alles in englisch Verfasse sind auch diese Regeln auf englisch. (will die mal ans Citadel Journal schicken)<p>
Codex Night Lords<br>
Rules:<br>
Night Lords follow all the rules for Chaos Space Marines.<br>
In addition as long as the Commander of the Strike Force is a Night Lord (Mark of Chaos is UNDIVIDED)and his army is made of this armylist they follow these rules:<p>
MELT AWAY: 	Night Lords have long learned to avoid unnecessary fights and so <br>
                they are known to simply vanish before proper reinforcemnet from <br>
                their enemy arrives. If at any moment the enemy becomes to <br>
                powerful the night lords can flee the battlefield in order to <br>
                avoid unnecessary casualities. If they decide to MELT AWAY the                 game ends after the turn of the Night Lords.<br>
                (you must announce that you are melting away during the turn of                 <br>
                your enemy and you cannot change your mind after you have chosen <br>
                to do so. Think of the artillery getting the order and starts <br>
                shelling immediately)<br>
                They cannot move forward but can only retreat. They can break <br>
                any close combat during this turn with an addition d6 for <br>
                movement. They can shoot normally in their shooting phase.<br>
                When the turn is over. The Night lords flee by calling in for a <br>
                Smoke-Artillery strike which causes enoug confusion for them to <br>
                escape. When fleeing the battlefield, the enemy gets an <br>
                additional victory point for every destroyed Unit and one <br>
                Victory point for every unit that fled, since they belive to <br>
                have routed (and in most cases they will) their enemy.<p>
Note: 	In most cases fleeing the battlefield will make you loose the battle but         for campaign purposes this can be a very funny idea since you never know when your enemy flees before punching you for a last time. So maybe he had inflicted more casualities than you and just decided to get the hell out of there before you bring in the heavy hitters.<br>
Or he just need to inflict one more hit on some character in order to achieve his goal.<p>
AMBUSH:	If the Night Lord army consists of at least two Veteran Squads. You can         <br>
        decide one squad to ambush any enemy unit in reserves. This is resolved <br>
        as if the Veterans would have fired once at the enemy unit (may it be <br>
        tank or unit) as if from close range (vehicles are hit from the side).<br>
        The Ambushing squad isnt placed on the battlefield and CANNOT         <br>
        infiltrate. It will arrive in the turn after the ambushed unit was about <br>
        to enter the game as they sought a safe route to avoid further         detection. Place them at the border of your battlefield and make one <br>
        extra move.<br>
        (If the Squad includes a rhino it can move 12" in ist first turn and <br>
        drop ist passengers as normal)<p>
CYNISM:	The Night Lords regard the dedicated followers of chaos (Khorne         <br>
        Berzerkers, Plaguemarines) with the same cynism as their imperial <br>
        enemies. The only distinction is that they sometimes ally themselves <br>
        with such a group but only if it fits their plan. <br>
        All Dedicated Followers count as ELITE and the Night Lords are not  <br>
        allowed to use more than ONE squad of these (maximum 1 squad of Khorne <br>
        Berzerkers /Plaguemarines/Thousand Sons/Noise Marines/Obliterators) This <br>
        means you cannot have one squad of KB and one squad of NM. You can have <br>
        only one of these. The only exception are TS marines, which can allways <br>
        be placed if your army includes a Tzeentch sorcerer. Tzeentch Sorcerer <br>
        are often found aboard Night Lord battleships as they serve as <br>
        navigators for all legions.<p>
MARKS OF <br>
CHAOS:	The Night Lords don't follow any aspect of chaos and it is rather a rare         <br>
        occasion that someone will dedicate his life to any particular chaos <br>
        god. In most cases these subjects leave the legion to form specialized         squads (yes the Night Lords have Khorne Berzerkers) to represent this         <br>
        all Marks of Chaos cost double and the chaosgifts  cost additional 5                 points. (exception are TS Sorcerers)<p>
Night Lord Veterans ONLY:<br>
GRIM <br>
REAPERS:	If a unit of enemies breaks after it was shot or beaten in close                 <br>
                combat by a squad of Night Lord Veterans the CSM player is                 allowed to shoot again at the fleeing unit. The Night Lords                 <br>
                count as standing as they surely enjoy every kill. Resolve <br>
                shooting before moving the routet unit (maybe you wont move at <br>
                all) The same applies to an enemy unit that breakes from close <br>
                combat. The night lords mercilessy gun everything down. The <br>
                Night lords however never rush after an enemy so they never make <br>
                up follow up moves. They rather gun everything down.<br>
                If they want to follow up 3" they cannot shoot.<br>
                In addition Grim Reapers will shoot into close combat. Resolve <br>
                hits as normal but the half of the hits are placed on friendly <br>
                models (enemiy decides) and half on enemy. In case of heavy <br>
                weapons roll a d6 the higher one gets the opportunity to place                 <br>
                the hit. (in case of  two weapons roll  once the winner picks                 one heavy weapon and the loser takes the other one)<p>
DEMONS:	Night Lords rarely are accompanied by demons. It is rather that the         <br>
        allies of the NL are accompanied by demons. You can buy demons only if         <br>
        you posses a unit which bears the appropriate mark of chaos (eg. <br>
        Bloodthirster/Bloodletters/Fleshhounds/Juggernauts only when you have         one squad of Khorne Berzerkers etc)<p>
<br>
Army Lists:<p>
HQ: 		Commander with retinue  (No DEMON PRINCE)<p>
ELITE: 		Veterans, Terminators, 0-1 KB/NM/TS/OB/PM/Possessed, Greater                                 Demon (read Demon special rule)<p>
STANDARD: 	Cultists/Slaves (read Cannon fodder), Chaos Space marines,                 demons (read Demon special rule)<p>
ASSAULT: 	Raptors, Bikesquadron, demons<p>
SUPPORT:	Havocs, Land Raider, Predator, Dreadnoughts<p>
Special Character:<p>
Astaroth was once a simple Night Lord Marine. He survived the Heresy without any trouble never being outstanding. However, during a raid with his fellow NL they encountered a unit of Blood Angels protecting a city. He was giving covering fire as suddenly he was attacked by Mephiston, Lord of Death. His unit was completely destroyed and Astaroth got killed by Mephiston. As he dropped to the ground Mephiston kneeled over him, removed his helmet and saw Mephiston biting his neck. Struggling with death he heard a shot and suddenly he was dropped to the ground. The last thing he saw was his NL captain firing at Mephiston before dying at his hands. Later as he recovered he found himself aboard the Night Lord Barge. They had lost the battle and fled but he was taken by his brother NLs. The twisted Apothecaries of the NL couldnt understand why he lived but he soon started to develop greater powers and recovered very fast. <br>
Soon after he changed his attitude during battles, earning himself the respect of his brothers. He is soft spoken, calm and very cunning. He became captain and later he took command of one hunting party consisting of some three hundred Space Marines and a varying number of slaves/ renegade Imperial guardsmen and even Titans. He is proud owner of three Thunderhawk Gunships which he stole during a supply convoy raid and which should be delivered to the Patriarchs of Ulexis. Astaroth fears nobody and is known only to falter when fighting Blood Angels. No one knows that he fears the day he will meet Mephiston again for he is consumed by the red thirst.<p>
ASTAROTH<br>
Leader of Night Lord Hunting parties<p>
WS	BS	S	T	W	I	A	LD<br>
5	5	4	4	3	6	3	10<p>
Equipment:	Mastercraft Plasmapistol<br>
		Mastercraft Powersword<br>
		Mastercraft Boltpistol<br>
		Melterbombs<p>
Gun expert: 	Astaroth follows the same shooting rules as Cypher, as long he                 <br>
                isnt accompanied by a retinue he follows the rules for <br>
                independent characters.<p>
Vampire:	Each time Astaroth slays an enemy and is no longer in close <br>
                combat he must pass a LD test or Starts sucking the blood out of <br>
                his enemy. If he is attacked while feasting he will stop <br>
                feasting and get frenzy. (He will fight as normal but having <br>
                double attacks for this turn). <br>
                Astaroth will feast on his victim for x turns where x ist the <br>
                number of wounds the victim possesed. (hell there's a lot of <br>
                blood in a Space Marine Captain *g* )<br>
                While feasting Astaroth follows the rules for independent <br>
                Characters and the unit he led may move on because they know <br>
                this situation. <p>
Pirate:		Astaroths raids provide all traitor legions with equipment from                 <br>
                the empire. If your CSM army includes Astaroth you are allowed <br>
                to make one selection from the Imperial Guard or Space <br>
                Marine Codex (who would bother on Sororitas stuff..)<p>
Grim Reaper:	Astaroth is a night Lord Veteran and so follows the same grim <br>
                reaper rule as NL Veterans (as long he doesnt get thirsty...)<p>
Prisoners:	CAMPAIGN ONLY.<br>
		Astaroth is known for using slaves and prisoners for cannon <br>
                fodder attacks.<br>
		After a game roll a d6 for every killed model (Note: normal <br>
                soldiers/Eldar Guardians/DE Warriors etc. No Space Marines, <br>
                aspect warriors etc and forget Tyranids you cant force <br>
                tyranids to do something you want !!). On 6+ it survives and can <br>
                be out into a special Slave Unit which will serve as cannon <br>
                fodder for astaroth. The models are drugged beyond sanity and <br>
                will always attack the enemies of Astaroth. After the game they <br>
                die of exhilaration.<p>
VAMPIRE:	Astaroth WONT fight Mephiston. Should he ever meet Mephiston on                 <br>
                the battlefield both will lock gazes and both will read each <br>
                other mind. Roll a d6 at the beginning of each turn.<br>
                Remove both models from the game. Both will have shielded <br>
                themselves with a psychic ability which only evolves if two <br>
                vampires are next to each other. The game will proceed normal <br>
                but the models will read each others thoughts until the game <br>
                finishes. After the game is finished place the models back on <br>
                the battlefield with a distance of 12". Asatroth gets the first <br>
                turn and must escape the battlefield.Mephiston will attack <br>
                Astaroth in order to destroy him.<p>
Your CSM army can include Astaroth as its Commander (if ist a Night Lord only army) or as a special character. (counting as HQ)<p>
Costs:	180 pts<br>
Editors Note:<p>
Astaroth is based on Cypher so I took the point costs of cypher and added a bit in order to represent his influence on the army. As he doenst own an divine protection i thought it ok to give him all these adavantages.<br>
Astaroth is an evil Vampire which fears that his creator (Mephiston) will destroy him. In most cases Astaroth will escape the battlefield. (maybe you hit him with plasmappistols).<br>
Think of Astarorth being a bit like the chracter bitten by Lestart like in "interview with  Vampire" the only difference is that he evades his master because he knows that he's evil.<p>

&gt;Codex Night Lords
&gt;Rules:
&gt;Night Lords follow all the rules for Chaos Space Marines.
&gt;In addition as long as the Commander of the Strike Force is a Night Lord (Mark of Chaos is UNDIVIDED)and his army is made of this armylist they follow these rules:
&gt;MELT AWAY: 	Night Lords have long learned to avoid unnecessary fights and so 
&gt;                they are known to simply vanish before proper reinforcemnet from 
&gt;                their enemy arrives. If at any moment the enemy becomes to 
&gt;                powerful the night lords can flee the battlefield in order to 
&gt;                avoid unnecessary casualities. If they decide to MELT AWAY the                 game ends after the turn of the Night Lords.
&gt;                (you must announce that you are melting away during the turn of                 
&gt;                your enemy and you cannot change your mind after you have chosen 
&gt;                to do so. Think of the artillery getting the order and starts 
&gt;                shelling immediately)
&gt;                They cannot move forward but can only retreat. They can break 
&gt;                any close combat during this turn with an addition d6 for 
&gt;                movement. They can shoot normally in their shooting phase.
&gt;                When the turn is over. The Night lords flee by calling in for a 
&gt;                Smoke-Artillery strike which causes enoug confusion for them to 
&gt;                escape. When fleeing the battlefield, the enemy gets an 
&gt;                additional victory point for every destroyed Unit and one 
&gt;                Victory point for every unit that fled, since they belive to 
&gt;                have routed (and in most cases they will) their enemy.
&gt;Note: 	In most cases fleeing the battlefield will make you loose the battle but         for campaign purposes this can be a very funny idea since you never know when your enemy flees before punching you for a last time. So maybe he had inflicted more casualities than you and just decided to get the hell out of there before you bring in the heavy hitters.
&gt;Or he just need to inflict one more hit on some character in order to achieve his goal.
&gt;AMBUSH:	If the Night Lord army consists of at least two Veteran Squads. You can         
&gt;        decide one squad to ambush any enemy unit in reserves. This is resolved 
&gt;        as if the Veterans would have fired once at the enemy unit (may it be 
&gt;        tank or unit) as if from close range (vehicles are hit from the side).
&gt;        The Ambushing squad isnt placed on the battlefield and CANNOT         
&gt;        infiltrate. It will arrive in the turn after the ambushed unit was about 
&gt;        to enter the game as they sought a safe route to avoid further         detection. Place them at the border of your battlefield and make one 
&gt;        extra move.
&gt;        (If the Squad includes a rhino it can move 12&quot; in ist first turn and 
&gt;        drop ist passengers as normal)
&gt;CYNISM:	The Night Lords regard the dedicated followers of chaos (Khorne         
&gt;        Berzerkers, Plaguemarines) with the same cynism as their imperial 
&gt;        enemies. The only distinction is that they sometimes ally themselves 
&gt;        with such a group but only if it fits their plan. 
&gt;        All Dedicated Followers count as ELITE and the Night Lords are not  
&gt;        allowed to use more than ONE squad of these (maximum 1 squad of Khorne 
&gt;        Berzerkers /Plaguemarines/Thousand Sons/Noise Marines/Obliterators) This 
&gt;        means you cannot have one squad of KB and one squad of NM. You can have 
&gt;        only one of these. The only exception are TS marines, which can allways 
&gt;        be placed if your army includes a Tzeentch sorcerer. Tzeentch Sorcerer 
&gt;        are often found aboard Night Lord battleships as they serve as 
&gt;        navigators for all legions.
&gt;MARKS OF 
&gt;CHAOS:	The Night Lords don't follow any aspect of chaos and it is rather a rare         
&gt;        occasion that someone will dedicate his life to any particular chaos 
&gt;        god. In most cases these subjects leave the legion to form specialized         squads (yes the Night Lords have Khorne Berzerkers) to represent this         
&gt;        all Marks of Chaos cost double and the chaosgifts  cost additional 5                 points. (exception are TS Sorcerers)
&gt;Night Lord Veterans ONLY:
&gt;GRIM 
&gt;REAPERS:	If a unit of enemies breaks after it was shot or beaten in close                 
&gt;                combat by a squad of Night Lord Veterans the CSM player is                 allowed to shoot again at the fleeing unit. The Night Lords                 
&gt;                count as standing as they surely enjoy every kill. Resolve 
&gt;                shooting before moving the routet unit (maybe you wont move at 
&gt;                all) The same applies to an enemy unit that breakes from close 
&gt;                combat. The night lords mercilessy gun everything down. The 
&gt;                Night lords however never rush after an enemy so they never make 
&gt;                up follow up moves. They rather gun everything down.
&gt;                If they want to follow up 3&quot; they cannot shoot.
&gt;                In addition Grim Reapers will shoot into close combat. Resolve 
&gt;                hits as normal but the half of the hits are placed on friendly 
&gt;                models (enemiy decides) and half on enemy. In case of heavy 
&gt;                weapons roll a d6 the higher one gets the opportunity to place                 
&gt;                the hit. (in case of  two weapons roll  once the winner picks                 one heavy weapon and the loser takes the other one)
&gt;DEMONS:	Night Lords rarely are accompanied by demons. It is rather that the         
&gt;        allies of the NL are accompanied by demons. You can buy demons only if         
&gt;        you posses a unit which bears the appropriate mark of chaos (eg. 
&gt;        Bloodthirster/Bloodletters/Fleshhounds/Juggernauts only when you have         one squad of Khorne Berzerkers etc)
&gt;
&gt;Army Lists:
&gt;HQ: 		Commander with retinue  (No DEMON PRINCE)
&gt;ELITE: 		Veterans, Terminators, 0-1 KB/NM/TS/OB/PM/Possessed, Greater                                 Demon (read Demon special rule)

&gt;                isnt accompanied by a retinue he follows the rules for 
&gt;                independent characters.
&gt;Vampire:	Each time Astaroth slays an enemy and is no longer in close 
&gt;                combat he must pass a LD test or Starts sucking the blood out of 
&gt;                his enemy. If he is attacked while feasting he will stop 
&gt;                feasting and get frenzy. (He will fight as normal but having 
&gt;                double attacks for this turn). 
&gt;                Astaroth will feast on his victim for x turns where x ist the 
&gt;                number of wounds the victim possesed. (hell there's a lot of 
&gt;                blood in a Space Marine Captain *g* )
&gt;                While feasting Astaroth follows the rules for independent 
&gt;                Characters and the unit he led may move on because they know 
&gt;                this situation. 
&gt;Pirate:		Astaroths raids provide all traitor legions with equipment from                 
&gt;                the empire. If your CSM army includes Astaroth you are allowed 
&gt;                to make one selection from the Imperial Guard or Space 
&gt;                Marine Codex (who would bother on Sororitas stuff..)
&gt;Grim Reaper:	Astaroth is a night Lord Veteran and so follows the same grim 
&gt;                reaper rule as NL Veterans (as long he doesnt get thirsty...)
&gt;Prisoners:	CAMPAIGN ONLY.
&gt;		Astaroth is known for using slaves and prisoners for cannon 
&gt;                fodder attacks.
&gt;		After a game roll a d6 for every killed model (Note: normal 
&gt;                soldiers/Eldar Guardians/DE Warriors etc. No Space Marines, 
&gt;                aspect warriors etc and forget Tyranids you cant force 
&gt;                tyranids to do something you want !!). On 6+ it survives and can 
&gt;                be out into a special Slave Unit which will serve as cannon 
&gt;                fodder for astaroth. The models are drugged beyond sanity and 
&gt;                will always attack the enemies of Astaroth. After the game they 
&gt;                die of exhilaration.
&gt;VAMPIRE:	Astaroth WONT fight Mephiston. Should he ever meet Mephiston on                 
&gt;                the battlefield both will lock gazes and both will read each 
&gt;                other mind. Roll a d6 at the beginning of each turn.
&gt;                Remove both models from the game. Both will have shielded 
&gt;                themselves with a psychic ability which only evolves if two 
&gt;                vampires are next to each other. The game will proceed normal 
&gt;                but the models will read each others thoughts until the game 
&gt;                finishes. After the game is finished place the models back on 
&gt;                the battlefield with a distance of 12&quot;. Asatroth gets the first 
&gt;                turn and must escape the battlefield.Mephiston will attack 
&gt;                Astaroth in order to destroy him.
&gt;Your CSM army can include Astaroth as its Commander (if ist a Night Lord only army) or as a special character. (counting as HQ)
&gt;Costs:	180 pts
&gt;Editors Note:
&gt;Astaroth is based on Cypher so I took the point costs of cypher and added a bit in order to represent his influence on the army. As he doenst own an divine protection i thought it ok to give him all these adavantages.
&gt;Astaroth is an evil Vampire which fears that his creator (Mephiston) will destroy him. In most cases Astaroth will escape the battlefield. (maybe you hit him with plasmappistols).
&gt;Think of Astarorth being a bit like the chracter bitten by Lestart like in &quot;interview with  Vampire&quot; the only difference is that he evades his master because he knows that he's evil.
