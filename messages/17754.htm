Whole Zoats<br>
By Graeme Davis <p>
Dave Rohrbach wondered: <p>
Just out of curiosity, have Zoats been used in any of the WRPG books? They seem to be the "forgotten race". <p>
---------------<p>
I'd call them more the "stricken from memory race." Are you sitting comfortably? Then I'll begin... <p>
One day, when WFRP was very, very young, Bryan Ansell came into the office with a pencil sketch of this new race he'd created, which he called Zoats. The idea, he said, was to give Warhammer a race which was distinctively its own, and characterized the game as much as the Broo had characterized Runequest. None of us really like Zoats, so he challenged us to come up with something else that would do the job. Jes Goodwin and I came up with Fimir, but Zoats still had to stay. It's good to own the company. <p>
Zoats were briefly introduced in WFB (3rd ed, I think) and 40K (as slaves of the Tyranids, IIRC), but somehow, they never really stuck. I can't recall them being used in any published material apart from army lists, and I doubt they'll be in any future edition of any of the three games. <p>
Just put it down to natural selection - or at least, commercial selection. <p>
