Zoats share the six-limbed structure of Tyranid Warriors and are probably an ancient and highly evolved form of bio-construct created using Tyranid's own genetic material. Zoats were created as investigators, their main role being to understand and communicate with creatures outside the hive mind, assessing their value. Zoats are capable of assimilating information about languages and psychology with stunning speed, making rapid and accurate leaps in their comprehension of alien creatures. Due to this innate capability of understanding the subtlest nuances of facial and body language, Zoats are remarkably charismatic and enigmatic creatures who are able to convey more meaning in a look or gesture than a native can manage in a sentence.<p>
Zoats are often used to subvert members of alien races to bring them under the control of the hivemind, leading them against those who try to resist the Tyranids. In keeping with this role Zoats are tremendously strong warriors with thick, horny hides, Driven forward by their four powerful legs, a charging Zoat is like a battering ram of hide and muscle - such that sheer speed and momentum keep it moving even if mortally wounded. In hand to hand combat a Zoat can crush most oppents in seconds - living proof to other races of the awesome power of the Tyranids.<p>
