I've just got off the phone to Games Workshop and I've got a little more information on the game "Space Marine Arena" that was on show at Games Day this year, although it seems that they're still deciding on a name and it's rather unlikely to be Space Marine Arena in the end. As I suspected it is indeed a game using the Mortyr Engine (version 2 in fact). The decision was made to make the previously single player game Agents of Death a multiplayer experience with a number of cool maps and 40K characters. It is not being designed to go head to head with Quake 3 or anything, rather it will probably sell online for less than a full game normally does and be targeted at fans like you and me. It's basically being made to satisfy that desire that every GW gamer has to step into the shoes of a Marine and finally fire that gorgeous Bolt Gun at an Ork or other 40K warrior. <p>
Currently there are models for Orks, Terminators, Marines and Imperial Guardsmen (presumably with different skins available for various Chapters) and I'm told that they will play differently too, with a Terminator being quite slow yet well armoured and a Guardsman being quick on his feet but light on armour. The guns I saw in the game also weren't recognisable 40K weapons, but it seems that there are to be a number of old favourites (possibly with some taking on a slightly different style). If I heard anything else about this interesting development I'll let you guys know. <p>
