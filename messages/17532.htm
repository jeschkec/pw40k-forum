Chaos Cultists are often hidden within what sppears to be loyal communities of Imperial citizens.  They come from all classes and occupations, and can appear on any of the millions of planets with the Imperium.   These cultists are as great a threat to the Imperium as the many raids by renegade Chaos Marines, as they strike at the Imperium from within, spreading terror and destruction.  they corrupt the citizens and defenders of the Imperium and infect the Imperium with the taint of Chaos.<p>
These followers of the Chaos Gods organize themselves into covens structured as religions, and they subvert and recruit new members with promises of divine notice and rewards, with promises of power and gifts granted by the Gods of Chaos.  These Cults are especially attractive to ambitious individuals and those who are bored with living within the restraints of life within the Imperium.  Those who seek thrills and adventure are easily swayed by the leaders of these cults and brought to the worship of Chaos.   Some are seeking the power to warp reality through Sorcery and psychic abilities.   Some are seeking wealth, while others seek power over their fellow man.  The majority, though, are just misled ordinary people who are condemned by their misguided beliefs.<p>
Many followers of Chaos comes from those of very low intelligence, and those of unstable mentality.  Murderers and those who have commited other despicable crimes seek sanctuary within the Chaos Cults in an attempt to escape justice.<p>
Some Cults worship Chaos Undivided, while others worship an individual Chaos God.  Either way, they strive to further the cause of Chaos in its struggle to cominate the galaxy and destroy the Imperium.<p>
The Cults that cause the most damage are those that worship one individual Chaos God and have gained the power to summon daemons from the Warp to aid them.  The Inquisition is ever searching out these Cults, striving to rid the Imperium ofi the infection of Chaos.<br>
