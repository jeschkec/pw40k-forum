Die Regeln sind nicht mehr offiziell, aber hier sind sie<br>
Njal Stormcaller <p>
Njal Stormcaller may be used in your Space Wolves army where both players have agreed to use special characters. If you choose Njal he counts as your Rune Priest choice and does use up an HQ slot. You may not buy him more wargear and you must use him exactly as described below Njal storm Caller is the Space Wolves greatest Rune Priests and possibly the greatest Librarian in the Imperium. Njal Stormcaller's long saga began many years ago upon the cold oceans of Fenris. In ships of wood and skin his tribe put to the sea after their lands sank amidst the trial of fire and water. For many months they wandered the ehaving oceans of Fenris in search of new lands. After a mighty sea battle they defeated their rivals and took possession of the land born with the turning of the great year. In battle the young Njal fought with such ferocity that not even a full-blooded warrior dare stand before him. Leaping from oar to oar he threw himself upon the enemy ships, clearing the whole decks and casting foes into the engulfing waters. At the battles end he lay exhausted on the deck, a spear point embedded in his breast. The pall of death lay upon him. Njal's valor would have ended there, doubtless passing into the legends of his tribe, but his bravery had not gone unnoticed. His dying body was plucked from the enemy ship by a Wolf Priest of the Space Wolves and was taken back to Asaheim. <p>
 Points WS BS S T W I A Ld Sv <br>
Njal Stormcaller 224 6 5 4 4 2 5 (4)5 10 2+ <p>
Wargear: Bolt Pistol, Rune Staff force weapon (Counts as Runic staff and Force Weapon), Night Wing the Psyber Raven, Runic Armor, Wolf Pelt, Wolf tooth Necklace<br>
SPECIAL RULES <p>
Independant Character: Unless Njal Stormcaller has a Wolf Guard Body Guard he is a independent character and follows all the special rules as detailed in the Warhammer 40,000 rulebook.<p>
Wolf Guard body Guard: A Wolf Guard Body guard may accompany Njal. See the entry in the Space Wolf codex for Wolf Guard body guard. <p>
Psychic Power - Storm of Destruction: Njal may attempt to use the Storm of Destruction in the assault phase and it allows him to re-roll missed attacks for the turn. <p>
Psychic Power - Storm Caller: Njal may use the Psychic Power Storm caller in the shoot phase of a Space Wolf turn. Njal can use his powers to call up a blizzard of psychic energy which can be used to hide friendly troops from the enemy. He may not shoot on the same turn that he calls up the storm. No Psychic Test or Leadership test is needed to cast this power. Njal may summon this storm over himself and the unit he is with or over any friendly unit that has a model withing 12" of him. This unit counts as being in cover for rules purposes and so will receive a 5+ cover save and will strike first in Close combat until the end of the following enemy turn. Units that are protected in this way may assault and, if they do so and the enemy also counts as being in cover, attacks are resolved in order of initative. <p>
Nightwing Psyber Raven: Nightwing was fashioned for the Rune Priest Njal Stormcaller by the Iron Priest Ulf Blackbrow to repay a dept of saving his life. The Psyber Raven is intune to Njals Brain pattern. Night Wing may fly ahead of Njal to spot out enemy infiltrators. To represent this all enemy infiltrators may only infiltrate on a 4+ (rolling separately for each unit). In addition, Nightwing always fights alongside of Njal in Close Combat. To represent this Njal get's +1 to his attacks (already included in his profile).<p>
Mentor of Ulrik: You may not choose Njal as Ulrik's Mentor because the +1 WS is already included in his profile to represent that he is Ulrik's friend and mentor. <p>

Ich sage meinem Gegner nicht, das Wolfsscouts kommen.

&gt;&gt;Aber ein was muß ich noch wissen, weil das im Regelbuch/Codex
&gt;&gt;nich ganz klar wird.
&gt;&gt;Wenn ich jetzt Truppen in Reserve halte, muß mein Gegner wissen, was 
&gt;&gt;das für Truppen sind? Nicht, oder?
&gt;&gt;Muß ich meinen Gegner sagen, dass ich Wolfsscouts hinter seinen Linien
&gt;&gt;aufstellen will oder kann ich ihn damit richtig überraschen?
