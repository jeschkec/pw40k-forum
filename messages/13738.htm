0-1 GREAT HARLEQUIN <br>
  Points/Model WS BS S T W I A Ld Sv <br>
Great Harlequin 60 7 5 3 3 3 8 4 10 * <p>
Options: The Great Harlequin may be given any equipment from the Harlequins Armoury.<p>
<br>
SPECIAL RULES <p>
Independent Character: The Great Harlequin is an Independent Character and follows the independent character special rules in the Warhammer 40,000 rulebook. <p>
  <br>
0-1 SHADOWSEER <br>
  Points/Model WS BS S T W I A Ld Sv <br>
Shadowseer 70 6 5 3 3 2 7 3 10 3+ <p>
Options: The Shadowseer may be given any equipment from the Harlequin Armoury.<p>
<br>
SPECIAL RULES <p>
Independent Character: The Shadowseer is an Independent Character and follows the independent character special rules in the Warhammer 40,000 rulebook.<p>
Psychic powers: The Shadowseer has the following psychic powers (see page 74 of Warhammer 40,000): <br>
Misdirection: The Shadowseer reaches into the minds of the enemy, baffling them with contradictory psychic messages. This psychic power is used at the start of the enemy's assault phase and lasts until the start of the next Harlequins' turn. Any enemy unit wishing to charge the Shadowseer or unit they are with must first pass a Leadership test on 3D6. If the test is failed the enemy unit may do nothing in that assault phase. <br>
Veil of Tears: The Shadowseer uses his powers to bend light, concealing them from the enemy. This psychic power is used at the start of the enemy's shooting phase and lasts until the start of the next Harlequins' turn. Any enemy unit wishing to shoot at the Shadowseer or unit they are with must test using the night-fighting rules (ie they must roll 2D6x3 to see if the Harlequins can be seen). If the enemy cannot see the Shadowseer's unit they may target another visible unit instead. If the night-fighting rules are being used as part of the mission being played, then the Shadowseer can only be seen at half the normal range (for example if a unit can see 20" then they can only target the Shadowseer if they are within 10"). <p>
<br>
  <br>
ELITES <br>
0-?? DEATH JESTERS <br>
  Points/Model WS BS S T W I A Ld Sv <br>
Death Jester 47 6 3 3 3 1 4 2 9 3+ <p>
Squad: You may include between 1 and 3 Death Jesters for each Elites choice.<p>
Weapons: Shrieker cannon and power blades.<p>
Options: A Death Jester may exchange their Shrieker Cannon for one of the following: Shuriken cannon at +5 points; Eldar missile launcher at +15 pts; Brightlance at +10 pts. A Death Jester may be given additional wargear (not weapons) from the Harlequins armoury.<p>
<br>
SPECIAL RULES <p>
Independent character: Death Jesters are independent characters and follow all the special rules for indepedent characters given in the Warhammer 40,000 rulebook. Death Jesters bought under the same Elites choice still act independantly. <p>
  <br>
0-1 SOLITAIRE <br>
  Points/Model WS BS S T W I A Ld Sv <br>
Solitaire 90 8 5 4 3 3 8 4 * * <p>
Options: A Solitaire may be given any equipment allowed by the Harlequins armoury.<p>
<br>
SPECIAL RULES <p>
Individual: A Solitaire is an independent character and follows all the special rules for indepedent characters given in the Warhammer 40,000 rulebook. In addition, a Solitaire can never join any other unit Spritless: It is postulated by Imperial scholars that a Solitaire has no soul to speak of, and this may be true. They show no evidence of emotions and psychic powers which attack the mind have no effect on them whatsoever. A Solitaire does not have to take any Leadership tests of any kind (morale checks, pinning, etc.). In addition, any attack which relies upon the Solitaire's Leadership value (for example a neuro-disruptor or the Farseer psychic power Mind War) have no effect on them at all and automatically fail.<p>
Blitz Attack: When a Solitaire moves at full speed they are a blur of light, faster than any other living creature. A Solitaire can assault 12" instead of the normal 6" (double the dice roll if moving through difficult terrain). Rather than gaining +1 Attack for charging into an assault, a Solitaire gains +1 Attack for each inch of unused charge distance up to a maximum of +6 Attacks. For example, if a Solitaire charges into an enemy 8" away then they gain +4 Attacks. <p>
  <br>
TROOPS <br>
0-?? HARLEQUIN TROUPE <br>
  Points/Model WS BS S T W I A Ld Sv <br>
Harlequin 25 5 3 3 3 1 6 2 9 * <p>
Squad: The troupe consists of between 5 and 10 Harlequins.<p>
Weapons: Shuriken pistol and close combat weapon.<p>
Options: Up to 2 models in the squad may exchange their close combat weapon for a Harlequin's Kiss at +5 points per model, and up to two models in the squad may exchange their close combat weapon for a power weapon for +6 points per model. The Harlequins can be armed with hallucinogen grenades for +2 points per model, plasma grenades for +2pts per model, tanglefoot grenades for +4 pts per model and haywire grenades for +3 points per model.<p>
  <br>
0-?? MIME TROUPE <br>
  Points/Model WS BS S T W I A Ld Sv <br>
Mime 10 4 3 3 3 1 5 1 8 5+ <p>
Squad: The troupe consists of between 5 and 10 Mimes.<p>
Weapons: Shuriken pistol and close combat weapon.<p>
Options: Mimes may be armed with hallucinogen grenades for +2 pts per model, haywire grenades for +3 pts per model, plasma grenades for +2 pts per model and tanglefoot grenades for +4 pts per model.<p>
<br>
SPECIAL RULES <p>
Not Harlequins: Mimes are not full Harlequins yet and so do not use many of the specialised equipment reserved for the use of those who have passed the Ritual. Mimes therefore do not benefit from the special rules for Holo-suits, Flip Belts or Masks of Fear.<p>
Superb infiltrators: Mimes can gain access to almost anywhere, moving unseen and unnoticed past sentries and sensor posts. Mimes can infiltrate in missions where the inflitrators special rules are used, as detailed in the mission itself. If the mission does not normally use the infiltrators special rules then the Mimes set up as normal but may have one free movement phase before the first turn starts. In scenarios where the Mimes would normally be kept in reserve they may be deployed on the table as normal. For example, in the Patrol mission you can normally deploy only one unit of Troops. However, a Harlequin player can deploy one Harlequin Troupe and any Mimes Troupes in the army. <p>

Options: Any model in the squad may be armed with a shuriken pistol for +2 pts per model. Any model in the squad may exchange the jetbike's shuriken catapults for a fusion gun for +5 pts.<p>
