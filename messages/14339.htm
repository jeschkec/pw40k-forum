CODEX: CHAOS: BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD!<br>
By Matthew Plonski<p>
S<br>
ervants of Khorne stood from horizon to horizon, filing the air with their shrieks, gibbers, and howls of blood.  Their battle banner strained in the coppery wind that blew across their ranks.  It was a banner of deepest, darkest red, but with a single rune and a legend or simple devotion: Blood for the Blood God.  At some secret signal all fell silent, and then came a single shriek of dark and bloody loyalty, a pact of hate and death.  It echoed from leather skins, and grew to shake the clouds.  And far above the Daemon’s ranks, there was an answering roar of bloody approval, torn from Khorne’s brazen throat.<br>
- The Tome of Blood<br>
THE LEGIONS OF KHORNE<br>
Khorne is the Blood God, the angry and murderous god of Chaos, one of the great four Powers.  His great brass throne sits upon a mountainous pile of bones – the remains of his followers who have died in battle, and of the many they have killed in his name.  The growing bone pile reflects the success of his worshippers, feeding his glory but never quenching his thirst for blood and death.<p>
This book is designed to allow players of Warhammer 40,000 the ability to embrace the Huntsman of Souls as their master, and to contribute to the pile of bones, by fielding in battle a force completely dedicated to Khorne and all that he represents.  A Khorne Army is best described as single-minded, only concerned with the death and destruction of its enemy to the neglect of all else, including it’s own well being.  The phrase, “Blood for the Blood God!” is a mantra to all of Khorne’s worshippers, and will be used to describe such a pure, chaotic army.<br>
ARMY SELECTION<br>
You may only take a Blood for the Blood God! Army, chosen from this army list, if your opponent agrees to it before hand.<p>
If playing an extremely large game in which you may use multiple detachments, any allied forces may not include Slaanesh’s daemons, Noise Marines, characters with the Mark of Slaanesh, or, in fact, any sorcerers at all.  It is a rare day when the followers of the Blood God fight along side the minions of the Lord of Pleasure, so it should only be allowed under the most extreme circumstances.<br>
SPECIAL RULES<br>
 The Chosen Company: Throughout the history of the World Eaters, one company of Marines has consistently been at the forefront of all conflicts that it participates in, and are always amongst the first to engage the enemy in close combat.  This force has become known as The Chosen Company, for, even though they are indistinguishable from other Berserker Companies, a surprised Lord of Khorne will often notice that the first of his squads to enter into hand-to-hand belongs to this long-blessed legion.  <p>
Before the start of the battle, make note of which squads of Berserkers, Possessed, or Destructors of Khorne begin with a unit size of 8.  If one of these units is the first in the Khorne army to make it to close combat, it obviously consists of members from The Chosen Company, and receives a +1 to all combat results for the remainder of the battle.  Note: If another unit type or a unit not originally numbering 8 makes it into combat before a unit that would classify as possibly being from The Chosen Company, then no unit receives the benefit.  If more than one qualifying unit makes it into close combat in the same Assault Phase, or if another non-qualifying unit does the same, then simply choose which qualifying unit is from The Chosen Company for this battle.  The only units that are allowed to enter into close combat without disqualifying another from becoming The Chosen Company are units chosen from the Fast Attack section of the army list.<p>
Characters: All champions and other characters in the Blood for the Blood God! Army are assumed to have the Mark of Khorne.  The champions in special unit types, Bloodletters, Possessed, & Khrongors, are considered characters and therefore eligible for Possession by a Bloodthirster.<p>
There can be only one: A Blood for the Blood God! Army is the warband of a powerful leader.  To represent this, the army must be led by either a Khorne Lord or a Daemon Prince.  Furthermore, you may not include both a Daemon Prince and a Khorne Lord in the same army.  If playing an extremely large game with multiple detachments, then the second and subsequent detachments do not have to be led by a Daemon Prince or a Khorne Lord (HQ choices may be purely Renegades and/or Bloodthirsters), but still cannot have both.<p>
Summoning: Daemons are attracted to a battle through unholy prayers and the miasma of desolation and war.  Bloodthirsters, Bloodletters, Flesh hounds, and Juggernauts are kept in reserve at the start of the game, even if the mission does not normally use the Reserves special rule – so do not set up Daemons, apart from Daemon Princes, with the rest of the army.<p>
Starting with the second turn roll a D6 for each Daemonic unit, at the start of the assault phase, in the Khorne player’s turn, to see if it becomes available.  If you roll equal to or greater than the number shown below the unit is available and must be summoned.  Note that Bloodthirsters are not summoned in this manner, and have their own Possession Special Rule.<br>
Turn	2	3	4+<br>
D6	4+	3+	2+<br>
Add +1 to the dice roll of any Khorne troops are within 6” of the enemy at the start of the Assault Phase.<p>
When they become available the Daemons are summoned and deployed on the battlefield.  To deploy a summoned unit, place the Ordinance Blast marker so that it touches at least one model in the Blood for the Blood God! Army.  Then roll the Scatter die.  If you roll a “Hit” then the template stays in place.  If you roll an arrow it moves 2D6” in the direction indicated on the die.  Once the template has been placed the Daemon unit may be deployed anywhere on top of the template.  Summoned packs may make assault moves as normal on the turn they appear.<p>
Corrupted: Although Khorne Space Marines were once true Space Marines, they have long since forsaken the ideals and aspirations of the Defenders of Humanity.  They do not receive the benefit of the “And They Shall Know No Fear” ability which applies to Space Marines who remain loyal to the Emperor.<br>
 ARMORY<br>
Khorne's Champions may pick up to two single-handed weapons from the list below. In addition, each character may be given up to 150 points worth of items of wargear, unless otherwise noted in their army list entry. You may not take duplicate items of wargear for the same model.  Items marked with an asterisk (*) are the only ones able to be taken by models in Terminator Armor.  Vehicle upgrades marked with a double asterisk (**) are the only ones allowed to be used by dreadnoughts.<p>

 BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD! ARMY LIST<br>
HQ<br>
0-1 LORD OF KHORNE<br>
	Pts/model	WS	BS	S	T	W	I	A	Ld	Save<br>
Exalted Champion	70	5	5	5	4	3	5	3	10	3+<br>
Mighty Champion	55	5	5	5	4	2	5	3	10	3+<br>
Options: The Lord of Khorne may take any equipment from the Armory.<br>
SPECIAL RULES<br>
Independent Character: The Lord of Khorne is an Independent Character and follows the independent character special rules in the Warhammer 40,000 rulebook.<p>
Fearless:  The Lord of Khorne is truly only at home on the battlefield.  Khorne cares not from where the blood flows, so the Lord’s life holds little value.  He is considered Fearless, will never fall back, cannot be pinned, and automatically passes any leadership-based test that he is required to make.<p>
Retinue: A Retinue of his finest warriors may accompany The Lord of Khorne.<p>
Squad: The squad consists of between five and nine Khorne Berserkers.  If the Lord of Khorne is in Terminator Armor, then the retinue may consist of Berserker Terminators instead of standard Berserkers.  If the Lord of Khorne has been gifted with a Juggernaut, then the retinue may consist of Bloodcrushers instead of standard Berserkers.<p>
The cost of the Retinue is taken from the relevant squad choice.<p>
Weapons: See the relevant squad choice.<p>
Options: The standard options available to the chosen squad type are available to the Retinue.  However, any number of members of the Retinue may be upgraded to Aspiring Champions, rather than just one, as is normally the case.<p>
One Aspiring Champion in the Retinue may become an Icon Bearer and may carry a Khornate Icon chosen from the Armory at the additional cost listed there<p>
Trusted servants of Khorne, the officers of the World Eaters and the other legions are held personally responsible for the bloodshed carried out in his name.  They are expected to set an example to their underlings by carrying the fight into the heart of the enemy.<p>
0-1 DAEMON PRINCE OF KHORNE<br>
	Pts/model	WS	BS	S	T	W	I	A	Ld	Save<br>
Daemon Prince	90	6	0	6	4	3	5	3	10	5+<br>
Weapons: All Daemon Princes are armed with a variety of weapons with which to slay their mortal enemies.  Typically these are huge axes, magical swords, or enchanted whips, but can also take many other forms.  The benefits for carrying these weapons are already included in the Daemon Prince’s profile.<p>
Options: The Daemon Prince may be upgraded with any number of the following: Wings for +10 points; an Axe of Khorne for +5 points; a Whip of Khorne for +10 points; a Collar of Khorne for +30 points; or Chaos Armor for +40 points (granting a 2+ Armor Save which may be taken instead of his 5+ Invulnerable Save for each wound suffered.  A weapon with an AP of 2 or lower can cancel it as normal, in which case the 5+ Invulnerable Save would still apply.) <p>
SPECIAL RULES<br>
Independent Character: The Daemon Prince is an independent character and follows all of the Independent Character special rules as given in the Warhammer 40,000 rulebook.<p>
Fearless: Daemon Princes never fall back and cannot be pinned.  They are assumed to automatically pass any Morale Check.<p>
Monstrous Creature: The Daemon Prince is a huge and terribly strong opponent.  It is treated as a Monsterous Creature and therefore rolls 2D6 for armor penetration and ignores armor saves in close combat.<p>
Invulnerable: A Daemon Prince is an unnatural creature made from the very stuff of Chaos itself and is therefore very difficult to destroy.  It is treated as being Invulnerable and may make an armor save against any and all wounds it takes, even those that would normally pierce it's armor or that allow no save to be made. Note that this save is on a 5+ and remains so even if the Chaos Armor upgrade is bought for the daemon.<p>
Daemon Princes are among the most exalted of Khorne’s followers: mortals who have been elevated to Daemonhood.  Their particular savagery reflects their humble origins.<p>
KHORNE RENEGADES<br>
	Pts/model	WS	BS	S	T	W	I	A	Ld	Save<br>
Renegade	55	5	5	5	4	1	4	3	10	3+/5+<br>
Number: You may include one to three Renegades as a single HQ choice.<p>
Weapons: Bolt pistol and close combat weapon<p>
Options:  A Renegade of Khorne may be equipped with any equipment from the Armory.<p>
SPECIAL RULES<br>
Lone Character: Renegades follow all of the rules concerning Independent Characters from the Warhammer 40,000 rulebook.  However, they may never be joined up with other units and always fight on their own.  The only exception is that they may lead units of Possessed or Chaos Hounds.  This does not stop them from using their proximity to friendly units to make them more difficult to hit by enemy shooting attacks.<p>
Fearless: A Renegade knows nothing but war, and even that holds no surprises.  They are considered Fearless, never fall back, cannot be pinned, and always are assumed to pass all leadership-based tests that they are called upon to make.<p>
Curse of the Eternal Warriors: A Renegade has been gifted by Khorne with supernatural immunity, granting him with an Invulnerable 5+ save that may be taken instead of his normal 3+ Power Armor save.  Improving a Renegade’s Power Armor with Wargear simply changes his 3+ save to the appropriate new one, and all effects of the new armor still apply.<p>
The Renegade Slayers of Khorne are the lost warriors, fighting without a legion.  Cursed to wander alone through the Eye of Terror, to occasionally join up with a Khorne Warband or crusade, slaughter, and live to fight another day.  Whether they are simply the last remaining Marines from a decimated chapter, or if they renounced their fellows and went off to kill undisturbed, it doesn’t matter.  They are often the most rewarded of Khorne’s followers, since mindless, soulless killing in the Blood God’s name is the best worship of all.<br>
 <br>
BLOODTHIRSTER OF KHORNE<br>
	Pts/model	WS	BS	S	T	W	I	A	Ld	Save<br>
Bloodthirster	140	9	0	8	6	4	4	5	10	5+<br>
Options: Some Bloodthirsters wear ornate Chaos Armor, forged in the furnaces of the daemon worlds, and quenched in the blood of Khorne’s enemies.  For an additional 40 points, a Greater Daemon of Khorne may be given Chaos Armor, granting a 2+ Armor Save which may be used instead of the daemon’s 5+ Invulnerable Save for each wound suffered (decide before rolling the save).  A Bloodthirster may be gifted with an Axe of Khorne for +5 points, and/or a Whip of Khorne for +10 points.<p>
SPECIAL RULES<br>
Possession:  A Bloodthirster must possess another model in order to enter the battlefield.<p>
At the start of the Chaos Player's second and subsequent turns, you must test to determine if the Bloodthirster successfully possesses a model in Khorne's Legion.  If there are any units in the Legion numbering 8 strong, or a multiple thereof, the Bloodthirster possesses a model in one of those units on a D6 roll of 4+.  If successful, choose any model in the unit and replace it with the Bloodthirster.  If unsuccessful, or if there isn't a unit with Khorne's Sacred Number of models, nominate one of Khorne's Champions, and that model is possessed on a D6 roll of 6, and the Champion is destroyed, replaced by the Bloodthirster.  If the Daemon is not summoned, continue choosing Champions until either the Bloodthirster is brought to life, or there are no more Champions to test.  Note that all Champions must be rolled for.<p>
Independent Character: The Bloodthirster is an independent character and follows all of the Independent Character special rules as given in the Warhammer 40,000 rulebook.<p>
Fearsome: If the Bloodthirster wins an insult their opponents automatically have to fall back without a Morale check being taken.  Opponents that never fall back or ignore Morale checks ignore this effect and will not fall back. <p>
Fearless: Bloodthirsters never fall back and cannot be pinned.  They are assumed to automatically pass any Morale Check.<p>
Monstrous Creature: The Bloodthirster is a huge and terribly strong opponent.  It is treated as a Monstrous Creature and therefore rolls 2D6 for armor penetration and ignores armor saves in close combat.<p>
Invulnerable: A Daemon Prince is an unnatural creature made from the very stuff of Chaos itself and is therefore very difficult to destroy.  It is treated as being Invulnerable and may make an armor save against any and all wounds it takes, even those that would normally pierce it's armor or that allow no save to be made.  Note that this save is on a 5+ and remains so even if the Chaos Armor upgrade is bought for the daemon.<p>
Wings: The Bloodthirster has wings.  This allows it to make a 12" assault move, ignoring any intervening terrain between them and the target.<p>
The Bloodthirsters are the most favored servants of Khorne.  They exist purely for combat and combat alone.  Their bloodlust extends far beyond mortal comprehension, and they will attack everything within their reach with terrible ferocity.  They do not know fear, other than of Khorne, and act regardless of the cost or consequence, although the usual consequences are death for whoever or whatever they face.  Their immense pride in their fighting abilities rarely permits them to call upon allies or servants, and they usually rely only upon their own strength and skill.<br>
 ELITES<br>
BERSERKER TERMINATORS<br>
	Pts/model	WS	BS	S	T	W	I	A	Ld	Save<br>
Berserker Terminators	56	4	4	5	4	1	4	2	10	2+<br>
Number: A Berserker Terminator Squad consists of between five and ten Berserker Terminators<p>
Weapons: Combi-bolter & power weapon.<p>
Options: Up to two Berserker Terminators can be armed with an autocannon at +20 points or a heavy flamer at +15 points.  Any model may upgrade their combi-bolter to a combi-flamer at +2 pts or a combi-meltagun at +3 points.  The power weapon may be upgraded to a power fist or lightning claw at +5 points, or a chainfist at +8 points.  Any model may trade in both the combi-bolter & power weapon for a pair of lightning claws for +5 points.<p>
Up to one model may be upgraded to an Aspiring Champion for no additional cost.  The Aspiring Champion has the same profile as the rest of the squad but may be given any additional equipment allowed from the Armoury.<p>
SPECIAL RULES<br>
Deep Strike: In the right circumstances, Berserker Terminators can teleport into battle, appearing almost anywhere on the battlefield.  To represent this they may set up using the Deep Strike rules, but only if the mission allows them to be used.  If it does not then the Terminators must set up normally with the rest of the army.<p>
Terminators: A number of special rules apply to Chaos Terminators.  See the Terminator Armor entry in the Wargear section for details.<p>
Fearless:  Berserker Terminators are insane madmen, and are thereby considered Fearless.  They will never fall back, cannot be pinned, and are assumed to automatically pass any Leadership-based test that they are required to make.<p>
Regardless of whether they were originally members of a Traitor Legion First Company, or if they have been turned to chaos over the centuries, those Chaos Marines Terminators marked by the Blood God are indeed mighty amongst the best troops in the galaxy.  Armed with a devastating array of close combat weapons, they can completely demolish a heavily armored vehicle or a large unit of enemy in a matter of seconds.<p>
0-1 UNIT OF BLOODCRUSHERS<br>
	Pts/model	WS	BS	S	T	W	I	A	Ld	Save<br>
Bloodcrushers	50	4	4	4	6	2	4	4	10	3+<br>
Aspiring Champion	+20	4	4	5	6	2	4	5	10	3+<br>
Number: A Bloodcrusher Squad consists of between one and ten Khorne Berserkers riding Juggernauts (bonuses included in profile)<p>
Weapons: Bolt pistol & close combat weapon.<p>
Options:  Up to half of the models may upgrade their bolt pistol for a plasma pistol at +6 points.  Up to half of the models may upgrade their close combat weapon for a power weapon for +15 points.  One model may upgrade both his bolt pistol and close combat weapon for a pair of lightning claws at +15 points.  The unit may be given Frag grenades for +1 point per model.  The unit may be given Krak grenades for +3 points per model.<p>
Up to one model may be upgraded to an Aspiring Champion at an additional cost of +20 points.  The Bloodcrusher Aspiring Champion is equipped with a bolt pistol & close combat weapon, and rides into battle on a Juggernaut (bonuses included in profile).  He may be given any additional equipment allowed from the Armoury.  The Aspiring Champion may not be given Terminator Armor.<p>
SPECIAL RULES<p>
Fearless:  Even before Khorne blessed the Bloodcrushers with the reward of Juggernaut mounts, they were some of his finest warriors.  They were Berserkers, are thereby considered Fearless.  They will never fall back, cannot be pinned, and are assumed to automatically pass any Leadership-based test that they are required to make.<p>
And so it was that a single squad of Khorne’s Warriors slew a hundred times their number, suffering not a casualty amongst them.  When the fortress’s defenders were all silent and their skulls were adorning the Blood God’s throne, the Berserkers were led by a vision to proceed into the courtyard, where they found their master’s rewards; a pack of Khorne’s Juggernauts.  Just as each member of the squad chose his prize of living blood and iron, the proximity sensors drew their attention to the skies where the sight of Imperial Drop Pods could just be seen entering the atmosphere.  The defenders’ reinforcements had arrived; there would be more skulls for the throne of Khorne before the day was through!<p>
POSSESSED BY BLOODLETTERS<br>
	Pts/model	WS	BS	S	T	W	I	A	Ld	Save<br>
Possessed	30	4	4	5	4	1	4	1	9	3+<br>
Possessed Champion	+15	4	4	5	4	1	4	2	10	3+<br>
Number: A Squad of Possessed Marines consists of between five and ten members.<p>
Weapons: Bolt pistol and close combat weapon.<p>
Rhino:  The entire squad may be mounted in a Rhino armored carrier at an additional cost of +50 points.<p>
Options: Up to one model may be upgraded to an Aspiring Champion at an additional cost of +15 points.  The Aspiring Champion may not take any additional equipment, but counts as a character when determining Greater Daemon Possession.  Any Possessed squad containing an Aspiring Champion may re-roll one of its dice when rolling on the Possessed by Bloodletters chart.  The second result must be taken or it has no effect if it is a duplicate.<p>
SPECIAL RULES<br>
Fearless:  If a Chaos Space Marine has given his body over to one of Khorne’s Bloodletters, emotion no longer holds any meaning, and he becomes Fearless.  He cannot be pinned, automatically passes any leadership based tests that he is required to make, and will never fall back.<p>
Possessed by Bloodletters: Roll twice on the table below at the start of the battle to find out what effects the daemons have on the bodies of the troopers in the squad.  Any duplicate rolls have no effect and are lost.<br>
1 Insanely Fast.  Models in the squad move 12” in the movement phase instead of 6”.  They still only have an assault move of 6”.<br>
2 Visage of Khorne.  They are treated as being Fearsome.  If the squad wins an assault their opponents automatically have to fall back, without a Morale Check being taken.   Opponents that never fall back or that ignore Morale Checks are not effected and will remain in combat.<br>
3 Berserk.  All of the models in the squad were previously Khorne Berserkers, and have +1 Attack.<br>
4 Hellblades.  No armor saves are allowed against close combat attacks made by models in the squad.<br>
5 Daemonic Aura.  All models in the squad count as having an Invulnerable saving throw.<br>
6 No effect.<p>
Drawn by martial prowess and mindless killing, the daemons of Khorne often attempt to overtake the body of one devoted to Chaos.  After a battle of wills, the host eventually succumbs, and allows the power of the daemon to transform his body into a horrible visage of destruction.  The whole is more viscous than the sum of its parts.<br>

SPECIAL RULES<br>
Fearless:  Khorne Berserkers are fanatical warriors, and are undaunted by even the most frightening sights.  They are considered Fearless.  They never fall back, automatically pass any Leadership-based test that they are required to make, and cannot be pinned.<p>
The Legions of Khorne swell with the ranks of many proud warriors.  A combination of martial pride and ceaseless slaughter, the Berserkers are the mark by which all the other of Khorne’s worshippers are measured.<p>

Weapons: Close combat weapon.<p>
Options:   Any model may purchase a bolt pistol to be used in addition to his close combat weapon for +5 points or instead of for +1 point.  One model may upgrade his close combat weapon for a flamer at +4 points.  The entire squad may be given Flak Armor (5+ save) for +4 points per model.<p>
Up to one model may be upgraded to a Khrongor Champion at an additional cost of +15 points.  The Champion is equipped with a close combat weapon and may be given any additional equipment allowed from the Armoury.<p>
Khorne’s Beastmen are bloodthirsty in the extreme, flinging themselves into the fray to slaughter with tooth and claw!  They are called “Khrongors”, and they kill in Khorne’s name.<p>

Options:  Up to one model may be upgraded to a Bloodletter Champion at an additional cost of +10 points.   The Champion may be equipped with any Khorne Gifts from the Armoury, including a Khorne Icon.<p>
SPECIAL RULES<br>
Invulnerable:  Bloodletters are protected by their Lord, Khorne, and are considered Invulnerable.  They are allowed to make an armor save against any and all wounds that are inflicted upon them, even those that would normally pierce their armor or that allow no save to be made.<p>
Summoned:  Daemons are summoned onto the battlefield as described in Codex: Chaos Space Marines.<p>
Called the Teeth of Death or the Takers of Skulls, Bloodletters seek the blood of Man to offer at the foot of the Skull Throne, ever hungry for fresh prey, ever willing to tear the warm red flesh with their talons and to smear the gore triumphant upon their curving horns.<p>
CHAOS HOUNDS<br>

Hound	4	3	0	3	3	1	3	1	5	-<br>
Number: A pack of chaos hounds consists of five to twenty hounds.<p>
Weapons: Bite (counts as close combat weapon).<p>
SPECIAL RULES<br>
Troop Choice: A pack of chaos hounds may be taken as a Troop choice only if the prerequisite number of Troops, according to the Force Organization Chart have already been chosen. <p>
Loyal: When led by a character with Wings or mounted on cavalry, hounds may make a 12” Assault Move.  This move is effected by terrain as normal.  Otherwise, when on their own or led by any other type of character, they make a 6” Assault Move as normal.<p>
Whenever Khorne sends warriors into battle, packs of wild dogs follow them.  Surviving on the corpses of the slain, these hounds often can be coaxed into service of a master with whom they will fight until the end.<p>

They are allowed to make an armor save against any and all wounds that are inflicted upon them, even those that would normally pierce their armor or that allow no save to be made.<p>
Summoned:  Daemons are summoned onto the battlefield as described in Codex: Chaos Space Marines.<p>
And to tell of his Beast: the like of it has never been seen.  He came upon a mighty steed of groaning iron and brazen steel, a thing of living metal that stood taller than a man and roared with all the furies of a thousand dead.  He sat securely proud in a deep saddle that grew out the very back of this accursed Beast, it’s high posts framing a massive head, part hound, part bull, part the incarnate soul of bloody hate.  As it came toward us we saw its thousand close-riveted plates, forged in dark fires and bound with runes.  Its breath was fear and its every step a thundering knell of doom.  As it bared its brazen, gore-speckled fangs, we lost all heart and turned, fleeing to the safety of the night and terrors still unseen.<p>

SPECIAL RULES<br>
Type: Bike<p>
Monsterous:  Attacks from a Bloodslaughterer in close combat ignore armor, and they roll 2D6 + strength vs. vehicle armor.<p>
Fearless:  The Bloodslaughterer is a Daemonic War Engine, possessed by a Khorne Bloodletter.  It knows no emotions other than rage and the pleasure of the slaughter of its foe.  It is considered Fearless.  It cannot be pinned, never falls back, and always makes any leadership-based test that it is required to make.<p>
One of the more plentiful of Khorne’s Daemon Engines, the Bloodslaughterer epitomes Khorne’s approach to warfare.  Amazingly fast, dangerous at range, and lethal in close quarters, these automatons fill the battlefield with fire and the scent of blood.

Options: Up to three Khorne Destructors may have one of the following weapons: missile launcher at +20 points; autocannon at +20 points; heavy bolter at +15 points; or lascannon at +35 points.<p>
One of the Destructors may be upgraded to an Aspiring Champion for an additional +20 points.  The Champion may be equipped with any additional equipment from the Khorne Armory.<p>
SPECIAL RULES<br>
Fire Lust: In every shooting phase where any member of the Destructor squad does not fire his weapon for any reason, roll a D6 for each member who did not fire.<br>
1-5: 	No effect<br>
	6:	Blood for the Blood God!  The Destructor flies into a rage, unleashing his weapon without discrimination.  He immediately fires his weapon at the nearest unit, friend or foe, regardless of any other circumstances (moving while carrying a heavy weapon, etc.).  If more than one unit is the same distance away, the Khorne player may choose, normal targeting rules apply.  If the target unit is a Khorne unit, then the opposing player gets to position any blast markers.<p>
When a warrior chooses the path of Khorne, they do not all desire hand-to-hand combat.  Khorne cares not from whence the blood flows!  The Destructors take their heavy weapons into battle to rain death, plain and simple.  If they are unable to kill enough for their taste, they turn their guns onto the closest target, to collect more skulls for the Throne of Khorne.<p>

Number:  A Minotaur pack consists of from three to ten models.<p>
Weapons: Close combat weapon.<p>
Options:  Any number of Minotaurs may purchase an additional close combat weapon for +5 points.  Any model may upgrade his close combat weapon for a two-handed weapon for +3 points (roll 2D6 + strength vs. vehicle armor).  One model may trade in its close combat weapon for a heavy flamer for +12 points.  One model may trade in its close combat weapon for an autocannon for +8 points.  One model may trade in its close combat weapon for a heavy bolter for +5 points. <p>
SPECIAL RULES<br>
Huge: A Minotaur is an incredibly large creature, and is not daunted by the firing of high caliber weaponry.  Therefore all weapons are considered to be Assault instead of Heavy when fired by a Minotaur.  This is not as advantageous as it may at first seem, due to the inaccuracy of the shots.  Any Assault weapons remain Assault.<p>
Blood Greed: A Minotaur pack only rolls 1D6 to determine it’s follow-up distance when pursuing a defeated enemy, as they are too busy eating the bodies of their victims.  They may consolidate 6” as normal.  If the Minotaur pack catches and destroys the fleeing unit, they then become subject to the rules for Fearless (never fall back, cannot be pinned, automatically pass any leadership-based test) and may pursue 2D6 inches as normal for the remainder of the battle.<p>
With an insatiable appetite for fresh blood, Minotaurs are naturally drawn to the service of Khorne.  Their lust for battle is sometimes overshadowed by their carnivorous nature, as their Blood Greed often distracts them from further battle as they quench their thirst on the flesh of their current victims.<p>

Options: The twin-linked bolter may be upgraded to a heavy flamer at an extra cost of +12 points.  The Dreadnought may replace its close combat weapon with a missile launcher at an extra cost of +10 points but its attacks are reduced to 2 if it does.  The Dreadnought may be equipped with any of the dreadnought-allowed vehicle upgrades from the Blood for the Blood God! Armory.<p>
SPECIAL RULES<br>
Fire Frenzy: Being in battle drives the Chaos Space Marine Dreadnoughts into a state of insane rage.   At times this will cause them to charge ferociously and lash out with their weaponry like blood-mad berserkers at other times to blaze away randomly at imaginary foes.  To represent this, roll a D6 before shooting with the Dreadnought and refer to the table below.<br>
1	Blood Rage!  Instead of shooting the Dreadnought moves D6” towards the nearest enemy, only stopping if it moves within 1” of an enemy model.  If this takes it within 6” of the enemy it must charge in the Assault Phase, but it doubles its Attacks characteristic in that Assault Phase (i.e., it counts as having an attacks characteristic of 6 rather than 3).  If the Dreadnought has been Immobilized count this result as a roll of 6 instead.<br>
2-5	Shoot normally<br>
6	Fire Frenzy!  The Dreadnought must fire all of its weapons twice, but may not move in the Assault Phase.  Roll to hit for all of the shooting attacks.  Then allocate each hit to a separate model, starting at the closest model to the Dreadnough (friend or foe) and then moving progressively further away.  Models in close combat may be shot at!  The Chaos player may choose what order he allocated the hits that were scored.  If you run out of targets then any further hits are wasted.  If the Dreadnought is in base contact with an enemy model count this result as a roll of 1 instead.<p>
With the body of one of Khorne’s Champions entombed inside, a Dreadnought becomes an insane machination of destruction.  Nearly uncontrollable, they are unleashed only in times of battle.<br>

The backbone of a Chaos Space Marine force, the Predator Tank is often customized by the Chaos Squats who maintain Khorne’s Daemon Engines.

The Chaos Land Raider is a multi-function vehicle.  Capable of transporting even the devastating Berserker Terminators, and providing fire support in quantity difficult to find in a Khorne Warhost, these vehicles are often found on the battlefields even within the Eye of Terror.<br>
 SPECIAL CHARACTERS<p>
KHÂRN THE BETRAYER<br>
	Points	WS	BS	S	T	W	I	A	Ld	Save<br>
Khârn the Betrayer	189	7	5	5	4	4	7	4(5)	10	2+<br>
A Blood for the Blood God! Army may include Khârn.  See his Special Rule, Outcast Leader.  He may only be used in a battle where both players have agreed to the use of Special Characters. Khârn must be taken exactly as detailed below, and may not be given any additional Wargear from the Armory.<p>
Wargear:  Plasma pistol, bolt pistol, frag & krak grenades, Chaos Armor, Gorechild, Collar of Khorne.<p>
SPECIAL RULES<br>
Outcast Leader: Khârn counts as one HQ choice.  If it is desired that he lead the army, then he counts as a Khorne Lord for the “There can be only one” rule, and operates as an Independent Character, following all rules from the 40k rulebook.  If he does not lead the army, he then is on the battle as a Renegade, and doesn’t count as a Khorne Lord.  He then is subject to the Lone Character Special Rule from the Khorne Renegades list entry.  No other Khorne Renegade Special Rules apply.<p>
Furious Charge: Such is Khârn’s ferocious enthusiasm to get to grips with the enemy that he may add +D6” to his move in the Assault Phase.  However, he can only use this bonus if it will actually get him into hand-to-hand combat that turn and it may not be used if he can not reach the enemy.<p>
Gorechild: Khârn’s huge and ancient chain-axe, Gorechild, is an artifact from the Great Crusade when the Space Marines reaved across the galaxy.  Gorechild’s jagged whirring teeth were torn from the jaws of mica-dragons on Luther Mcintyre, its haft is forged from adamantium and its head is a full three span across.  It is a deadly weapon capable of splitting an armoured Space Marine from head to crotch with one blow and is doubly dangerous in the hands of Khârn.  He is so skilled with Gorechild that in hand-to-hand combat the enemy’s WS is ignored and all his close combat attacks always hit on a roll of 2+.  This aside, Gorechild is treated as a normal power weapon.<p>
The Betrayer: Khârn may attack anyone nearby in his berserk fury, friend or for alike!  To represent this, roll to hit, but then each player takes it in turn to distribute the hits, starting with the Chaos player (ie, the Chaos player allocates and works out the effect of the first hit, his opponent allocates and works out the effect of the second hit, and so on).  The normal restrictions for allocating hits apply, so they must be allocated against models in base contact with Khârn first, then on models within 2” of him if all models in base contact are slain.  Within these restrictions a hit may be allocated against any model, including Chaos models, so it makes sense for the Chaos player to keep Khârn as far away from models on his own side as possible.<p>
Fearless: Khârn is completely Fearless and automatically passes and Leadersip-based tests he is called upon to make.  In addition he cannot be pinned by enemy fire.<p>
Khârn has dedicated his millennia-long existence to unleashing bloody carnage upon anyone and anything within reach.  He is drawn by the scent of war as a hungering hound is drawn by fresh meat and it has become impossible to tally his slaying.  Even in the Great Crusade when he fought in the assault companies of the World Eaters Legion he was known to be a brilliant but unstable warrior.  Indeed, the whole World Eaters Legion was viewed as excessively bloodthirsty and dangerously over-zealous in the suppression of planets that had not even defied the Emperor’s will.  When the Heresy came Khârn gladly led his warriors against his brother Marines, most notoriously in the drop site massacres of Istvaan V.<p>

Doombreed may be taken as a HQ choice in a Blood for the Blood God! Army if Special Characters has been agreed upon.  See also his special rule, Arrogant.  Doombreed must be taken exactly as detailed below, and may not be given any additional equipment from the Armory.<p>
Wargear:  Doombreed is armed with an Axe of Khorne and a Rod of Khorne.  He wears Chaos Armor (2+ armor save, may be used instead of the 5+ demonic Invulnerable save), a Collar of Khorne, and has Wings.<p>
SPECIAL RULES<br>
Daemon Prince: Doombreed is a Daemon Prince, and thereby follows all of the special rules for them, including Independent Character, Fearless, Monstrous Creature, and Invulnerable.<p>
Radiance of Dark Glory: A more intimidating commander than Doombreed does not exist in the 41st Millennium.  No one dare fail him.  All models within 12” of Doombreed and in his line-of-sight are considered Fearless.<p>
Arrogant: If Doombreed is included in the army, then none of the other HQ choices may be a Daemon Prince or a Lord.  This rule still applies even if playing a large game with multiple detachments.<p>
Scourge of Slaanesh: As an impassioned enemy of the God of Pleasure, Doombreed may re-roll one To Hit roll per round of close combat when fighting against any Slaaneshi Daemons, Noise Marines, or Characters with the Mark of Slaanesh.<p>
Khorne was the first of the great Chaos Gods to awake fully, and Doombreed was one of the first of his servants.  His true name has long been forgotten, but he was once human, a mighty Warlord who led armies which ravaged entire nations on Earth long, long ago.  His acts of genocide and murder pleased the young god Khorne, who rewarded him and made him one of his Daemon Princes.<p>
Since then Doombreed has continued to serve Khorne well.  He fought for his master at the side of Horus during the Heresy, and was aboard the Warmaster’s battle barge when Horus was slain and the Emperor mortally wounded.  Over the millennia he has returned to plague humanity countless times.<p>

A Blood for the Blood God! Army may include the Captain of the Chosen Company in the army as one of the HQ choices as long as Special Characters have been agreed to be taken.  Caramon does not count as a Chaos Lord when applying the “There can be only one” rule, as he rarely makes his presence known until the battle is already underway. Caramon must be taken exactly as detailed below, and may not be given any additional equipment from the Armory.<p>
Wargear:  Caramon is armed with a Hellblade (counts as a Master-crafted power weapon), a bolt gun, krak & frag grenades<p>
SPECIAL RULES<br>
Visage of Bloodletter: Caramon has been gifted with the ability to partially transform himself into a daemon of Khorne, which he refrains from doing until the moment he enters close combat.  His gains the head of a Bloodletter, becoming Fearsome (all enemies beaten in close combat automatically fall back).  His demonic attributes causes his armor save to be treated as Invulnerable. <p>
Captain of The Chosen Company: Caramon is not deployed at the beginning of the battle.  Instead, when one of the units in the army becomes The Chosen Company, choose any one of the models in the unit and replace him with Caramon.  Note that most likely this will be a model that has assaulted into close combat.  The model replaced is not considered slain, as it was simply Caramon to begin with, and his point value has been adjusted to take that into account.  <p>
The appearance of the Chosen Company is one of the most perplexing aspects of war with the Blood God. It is an eternal mystery how Caramon and his company always are the first unit in hand to hand.  If the captain knows, he has never revealed the reason.  It is rumored that a Lord of Khorne once was determined to investigate the Chosen Company, whether it was to understand their methods or to eliminate the annoying warriors is not known.   He carefully inspected all of his troops before battle.  Unable to find any trace of Caramon or his brethren, the Lord plunged into combat against some wretched Slaaneshi demonic hosts.  The slaughter was satisfying, and it was at his utmost amazement when he realized that Caramon the Rabid was slaying at his side!  His hand-selected retinue, his finest warriors, had been all from the Chosen!  From that point onward, the Lord forgot about his obsession with the Chosen Company, for he realized that the plans of Khorne are often beyond the minds of men.<p>

Techra	85	4(6)	4	5(10)	4	1	4	2(3)	10	2+<br>
A Blood for the Blood God! Army may include Techra, the Berserker Terminator Sergeant, in the army as a member of a Berserker Terminator Squad, replacing the Aspiring Champion, only if the taking of Special Characters has been agreed upon before hand.  Techra must be taken exactly as detailed below, and may not be given any additional equipment from the Armory.<p>
Wargear:  Techra is armed with two close combat weapons: The Daemon Weapon Bloodblade and a chain fist. <p>
SPECIAL RULES<br>
Bloodblade, Daemon Weapon: The spirit of a Greater Daemon of Khorne is bound within a huge axe, called Bloodblade, and wielded by a Sergeant of the World Eater First Company, Techra.  It has all of the normal properties of an Axe of Khorne.  Additionally, it grants Techra 2 extra points of Weapon Skill, and the ability to automatically kill any model successfully wounded by Bloodblade if the wounding die roll was a 6 regardless of the victim’s toughness, as if effected by Instant Death!  Any unit suffering casualties from Bloodblade are always considered to have been beaten in close combat, and if that casualty suffered from the Instant Death! Rule above, then the unit is considered to be outnumbered by at least 2:1.<p>
Multiple close combat weapons: Since Techra is equipped with two different close combat weapons, both with special effects, he must chose which weapon he is attacking with at the beginning of each close combat round.  He receives the +1 attack bonus for having two close combat weapons (not included on his profile), but the +2WS and the Instant Death! Rule only if he attacks with the Daemon Weapon.<p>
Death or Glory!:  When being Tank Shocked, and choosing the Death or Glory! Option, Techra may make two attempts to destroy the vehicle using his chain fist, as he has no ranged weapons.  If he fails to destroy the vehicle, he is killed as normal.<p>
Dangerous Possession: If a Bloodthirster successfully possesses Techra, roll another D6.  If the roll is anything other than another 6, Techra wards away the Greater Daemon and it is considered destroyed in terms of Victory Points.<p>
Berserker Terminator: Techra is subject to all the special rules for Berserker Terminators, including Fearless, Deep Strike, and Terminator Armor.<p>
Techra had fallen thousands of years ago with his Lord Angron.  As a sergeant of the First Company, he wore ancient and powerful Tactical Dreadnought Armor, and was equipped with a chain fist against which even the thickest of armor offered little protection.   It was due solely to his leadership that his close-knit squad of Terminators remained together after the disintegration of the World Eaters Legion.  Upon the field of battle, no one was more disciplined in his slaughter, or more in control with the precise application of his blind rage, and the others followed his example.  Between battles, he maintained order by instituting elaborate rituals of martial purity.  <br>
Once, as he was preparing the pre-combat blood rites that his squad would undertake, he felt an overwhelming presence as one of Khorne’s Bloodthirsters attempted to use his flesh to anchor his appearance in the material world.  Not willing to relinquish his life so that a daemon would be able to exist, Techra fought back.  Reciting ancient, forgotten incantations and exerting all of his mental energy, the sergeant allowed the beast’s axe to materialize in his hand, but forced the life essence of the daemon into the weapon.  He bound it with runes and bloodstone, and named the axe “Bloodblade”.  With it, Techra has killed thousands in Khorne’s name.  It is told that the only thing worse than suffering a bite from the Daemon Weapon is to watch a comrade be slain by it.  When the weapon is quenched in a victim’s blood Techra’s runes are no longer able to contain the daemon trapped inside, and the Bloodthirster lashes out, rending its victim in a vision of eternal hate that drives all that glimpse of it mad.<p>
T’SAN TAS, BLOODTHIRSTER OF KHORNE<br>

T’San Tas	220	9	0	8	6	4	4(7)	5(6)	10	2+/5+<br>
T’San Tas may only be included as a HQ choice when the taking of Special Characters has been agreed upon by both players.  T’San Tas must be taken exactly as detailed below, and may not be given any additional equipment from the Armory.<p>
Wargear:  T’San Tas is a favored servant of Khorne, and has been gifted with Chaos Armor (2+ armor save, may be used instead of the 5+ demonic Invulnerable save), Axe of Khorne, and Whip of Khorne.<p>
SPECIAL RULES<br>
Bloodthirster:  T’San Tas is a Bloodthirster, and is subject to all of the special rules concerning Greater Daemons, with the exception of his unique Summoning rules, below.<p>
Summoning: When summoned onto the battlefield, T’San Tas tears at the very fabric of reality, rending the souls of all mortals in the immediate area.  If the bloodshed is not sufficient for his taste, he will refuse to appear.  At the beginning of the Chaos player’s second and subsequent turns, you must attempt to summon T’San Tas.  Nominate any character in the Chaos army.  On a D6 roll of 4+, the character has drawn the attention of the Greater Daemon.  Center the Ordinance template on the character.  Every living model (Wraithlords, Wraithguard, Talos, Avatars, other daemons, Necrons, and all other non-living creatures are immune) touched by the template takes a wound on a 4+ with armor saves as normal, including the character and other friendly models.  If this attack is sufficient to cause 3 or more wounds, then remove the character and replace with T’San Tas.  If it is not sufficient, then T’San Tas will not appear this turn.  Do not proceed to the next character.  Note that it is quite possible for a Champion to be killed attempting to summon the Greater Daemon and not having been successful.<p>
The Greater Daemon, T’San Tas, has been the scourge of Khorne’s enemies for centuries.  Even more frightening is his desire to slaughter even those already fighting in the Blood God’s name.  Described as having the head of a Juggernaut and huge ram’s horns, many a Chaos Space Marine general has regretted calling on his services as he tears apart an entire unit of Berserkers before making his entry onto the field of battle.<br>
 BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD! WARGEAR<br>
Axe of Khorne: The model is gifted with a mighty Axe of Khorne, suffused with chaotic power and laden with death!  A hit from the Axe of Khorne ignores armor saves.  In addition, any to hit rolls of 6 allow the model to make an additional attack in close combat.  As long as you keep on rolling 6s you can keep on making additional attacks.  These additional attacks may be allocated against new opponents if desired.<p>
Banner of Rage: The Banner of Rage contains the bound souls of the most bloodthirsty of Khorne’s servants.  It radiates palpable waves of anger and lust for slaughter that beat upon the minds of those near it, driving them into a killing frenzy.  The banner may be used once per battle, in any assault phase (including your opponents).  Any models from the Chaos army that are within 2D6” of the standard may add +1 to their strength characteristic.<p>
Bionics:  If a model with bionics is killed, instead of removing it, place the model on its side.  Roll a D6 at the start of the next turn: on a roll of a 6 the model is stood back up with 1 wound, but on any other roll it is removed as a casualty.<p>
Chain fist: A chain fist is simply a power fist fitted with an attachment designed to carve through armored bulkheads or armored vehicles.  It is treated as a power fist, but 2D6 are rolled for armor penetration.<p>
Chaos Armor: Magically enhanced by the god of war, Chaos Armor may be taken as an upgrade for a model wearing power armor, increasing the save to 2+.  Note that although Chaos Armor gives the same protection as Terminator Armor, items that are “Terminator Only” may not be used with it.  If worn by a Daemon Prince or Bloodthirster, the 2+ save may be used instead of the model’s Invulnerable save if the wound would normally allow armor saves to be taken.<p>
Chaos Icon: This powerful Daemonic standard is surrounded by potent spells of summoning.  At the start of the battle, nominate one unit that must be summoned to be enslaved to the Icon.  At the start of any Chaos turn, this unit can be automatically summoned – no roll to summon or scatter is required, simply place the Daemonic unit within 6” of the Icon.  The unit can move in the movement phase and may make assaults as normal.<p>
Chaos Space Marine Bike: Riding a bike increases a Khorne Space Marine’s Toughness by +1.  The bike is generally fitted with twin-linked bolters, but these can be upgraded to a meltagun or a flamer at an additional cost of +10 points each.  Characters that have a retinue or are otherwise part of a unit may only be given a bike if all of the models in the unit also have bikes.  Chaos Space Marine bikes are fitted with scythes and blades which add +1 to the rider’s Attacks characteristics.<p>
Collar of Khorne: The Collar of Khorne that hangs around the model’s neck is said to be forged from the heat of Khorne’s rage at the very foot of the Blood God’s throne of brass.  The collar is able to suck the energy of the warp from around it, fortifying the wearer and also protecting it from psychic attack.  As a result, force weapons lose their special ability to kill the wearer outright, and psychic powers that target the wearer or include him in their area of effect are nullified and will not work on a D6 roll of 2+.<p>
Juggernaut of Khorne: A model mounted on a Juggernaut gains +2 Toughness and +2 Attacks.  Models in Terminator Armor, wearing Jump packs, having Wings, or riding a Chaos Space Marine Bike may not be mounted on a Juggernaut.  Note that models mounted on Juggernauts do not count as cavalry – Juggernauts are not noted for their speed!<p>
Jump Packs: Models wearing jump packs can move 12” per turn in the movement phase and can ignore difficult terrain as they move.  Models that are part of a unit may only be given a jump pack if all the models in the unit have jump packs.  Models wearing Terminator Armor or riding a bike may not be given jump packs.  Chaos Space Marine models equipped with jump packs can be dropped from low flying Doomlord attack craft and use their jump paks to swoop down on to the battlefield.   To represent this tactic they can setup using Deep Strike rules, but only if the mission allows for Deep Strike to be used.  If the mission does not allows troops to use these rules, then the model must be set up normally with the rest of the army.<p>
Lightning claw: Lightning claws count as a power weapon.  In addition the model may re-roll any To Wound rolls that fail to wound.  Models armed with a lightning claw only receive the +1 Attack modifier for an additional close combat weapon if the second weapon is also a lightning claw.  Because of this, lightning claws are often used in pairs.<p>
Master-crafted weapon: A master-crafted weapon follows the normal rules, except that you may re-roll one failed To Hit roll per turn for an attack made by the master-crafted weapon.  Master-crafted weapons are taken as an upgrade for a weapon already carried by a model and should be represented by a suitably ornate weapon on the model itself.  Note that you may not master-craft grenades!  The cost of a master-crafted weapon is in addition to the normal cost of the weapon.  However, only the actual cost of the upgrade will count against the 150-point limit on Wargear taken by a model (so a master-crafted power weapon would count as 15 points towards the 150-point limit, not 30 points).<p>
Rod of Khorne: Made from the bone of a slain psyker and topped with the Rune of Khorne, the rod is a deadly bane to all users of the sorcerous arts.  Counts as a close combat weapon.  In addition, any model in base contact with the wielder at the end of the Assault Phase that could possibly be considered a sorcerer or psyker is slain on a D6 roll of 3+ without any save of any kind.  Only one model may be slain per Assault Phase, but it may be done in both players’ turns.  Wounds from the slain model count towards combat resolution.  A model is considered a psyker if it has a psychic power, the potential to have a psychic power, the Mark of Tzeench, or if it is required to make a Leadership-based test to use a special, “magical” ability.  Also effected are Tyranid Synapse Creatures and Zoanthropes, but not a Culexus Assassin.  Best judgement is to be used when deciding who is and who isn’t a psyker.<p>
Slayer:  This two-handed chain axe is often taken by Khorne’s Berserkers.  It gives +1 strength, and causes the wielder to roll 2D6 + strength vs. vehicle armor.   Cannot be used in conjunction with any other close combat weapon or pistol.<p>
Spiky bits: Khorne Space Marines often add ornate and fearsome spikes to their armor to increase their death-dealing capabilities in hand-to-hand.  A Khorne Space Marine adorned with spiky bits may re-roll one close combat To Hit die per assault phase.<p>
Teleport Homer: Teleport homers produce a signal that can be locked onto by teleporting troops, enabling them to find a landing point with far greater precision.  If the template used by a teleporting Berserker Terminator squad to make a Deep Strike is centered on a model with a homer, then the unit won’t scatter.  Note that the homer only works for troops who are teleporting, not for those who are entering play using jump packs, drop pods or any other means.  Also not that the teleport homer must be on the table at the start of the turn that is it is used.<p>
Terminator armor: Khorne Space Marines wearing Terminator Armor may move and fire heavy weapons.  In addition, they may move and shoot twice up to 12” or once up to 24” with rapid-fire weapons.  This does not come without a price, however, since this armor is so bulky that they never pursue when they win a close combat, they may only consolidate.  Any model equipped with Terminator Armor has a 2+ armor save and also adds +1 to his Attack characteristic.  In addition, any model wearing Terminator Armor can be teleported onto the battlefield using the Deep Strike rules, but only if they are allowed by the mission.  If Deep Strike is not allowed, then they must be set up with the rest of the army as normal.<p>

<input type=hidden name="body" value="&gt;CODEX: CHAOS: BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD!
&gt;By Matthew Plonski
&gt;S
&gt;ervants of Khorne stood from horizon to horizon, filing the air with their shrieks, gibbers, and howls of blood.  Their battle banner strained in the coppery wind that blew across their ranks.  It was a banner of deepest, darkest red, but with a single rune and a legend or simple devotion: Blood for the Blood God.  At some secret signal all fell silent, and then came a single shriek of dark and bloody loyalty, a pact of hate and death.  It echoed from leather skins, and grew to shake the clouds.  And far above the Daemon’s ranks, there was an answering roar of bloody approval, torn from Khorne’s brazen throat.
&gt;- The Tome of Blood
&gt;THE LEGIONS OF KHORNE
&gt;Khorne is the Blood God, the angry and murderous god of Chaos, one of the great four Powers.  His great brass throne sits upon a mountainous pile of bones – the remains of his followers who have died in battle, and of the many they have killed in his name.  The growing bone pile reflects the success of his worshippers, feeding his glory but never quenching his thirst for blood and death.
&gt;This book is designed to allow players of Warhammer 40,000 the ability to embrace the Huntsman of Souls as their master, and to contribute to the pile of bones, by fielding in battle a force completely dedicated to Khorne and all that he represents.  A Khorne Army is best described as single-minded, only concerned with the death and destruction of its enemy to the neglect of all else, including it’s own well being.  The phrase, “Blood for the Blood God!” is a mantra to all of Khorne’s worshippers, and will be used to describe such a pure, chaotic army.
&gt;ARMY SELECTION
&gt;You may only take a Blood for the Blood God! Army, chosen from this army list, if your opponent agrees to it before hand.
&gt;If playing an extremely large game in which you may use multiple detachments, any allied forces may not include Slaanesh’s daemons, Noise Marines, characters with the Mark of Slaanesh, or, in fact, any sorcerers at all.  It is a rare day when the followers of the Blood God fight along side the minions of the Lord of Pleasure, so it should only be allowed under the most extreme circumstances.
&gt;SPECIAL RULES
&gt; The Chosen Company: Throughout the history of the World Eaters, one company of Marines has consistently been at the forefront of all conflicts that it participates in, and are always amongst the first to engage the enemy in close combat.  This force has become known as The Chosen Company, for, even though they are indistinguishable from other Berserker Companies, a surprised Lord of Khorne will often notice that the first of his squads to enter into hand-to-hand belongs to this long-blessed legion.  
&gt;Before the start of the battle, make note of which squads of Berserkers, Possessed, or Destructors of Khorne begin with a unit size of 8.  If one of these units is the first in the Khorne army to make it to close combat, it obviously consists of members from The Chosen Company, and receives a +1 to all combat results for the remainder of the battle.  Note: If another unit type or a unit not originally numbering 8 makes it into combat before a unit that would classify as possibly being from The Chosen Company, then no unit receives the benefit.  If more than one qualifying unit makes it into close combat in the same Assault Phase, or if another non-qualifying unit does the same, then simply choose which qualifying unit is from The Chosen Company for this battle.  The only units that are allowed to enter into close combat without disqualifying another from becoming The Chosen Company are units chosen from the Fast Attack section of the army list.
&gt;Characters: All champions and other characters in the Blood for the Blood God! Army are assumed to have the Mark of Khorne.  The champions in special unit types, Bloodletters, Possessed, & Khrongors, are considered characters and therefore eligible for Possession by a Bloodthirster.
&gt;There can be only one: A Blood for the Blood God! Army is the warband of a powerful leader.  To represent this, the army must be led by either a Khorne Lord or a Daemon Prince.  Furthermore, you may not include both a Daemon Prince and a Khorne Lord in the same army.  If playing an extremely large game with multiple detachments, then the second and subsequent detachments do not have to be led by a Daemon Prince or a Khorne Lord (HQ choices may be purely Renegades and/or Bloodthirsters), but still cannot have both.
&gt;Summoning: Daemons are attracted to a battle through unholy prayers and the miasma of desolation and war.  Bloodthirsters, Bloodletters, Flesh hounds, and Juggernauts are kept in reserve at the start of the game, even if the mission does not normally use the Reserves special rule – so do not set up Daemons, apart from Daemon Princes, with the rest of the army.
&gt;Starting with the second turn roll a D6 for each Daemonic unit, at the start of the assault phase, in the Khorne player’s turn, to see if it becomes available.  If you roll equal to or greater than the number shown below the unit is available and must be summoned.  Note that Bloodthirsters are not summoned in this manner, and have their own Possession Special Rule.
&gt;Turn	2	3	4+
&gt;D6	4+	3+	2+
&gt;Add +1 to the dice roll of any Khorne troops are within 6” of the enemy at the start of the Assault Phase.
&gt;When they become available the Daemons are summoned and deployed on the battlefield.  To deploy a summoned unit, place the Ordinance Blast marker so that it touches at least one model in the Blood for the Blood God! Army.  Then roll the Scatter die.  If you roll a “Hit” then the template stays in place.  If you roll an arrow it moves 2D6” in the direction indicated on the die.  Once the template has been placed the Daemon unit may be deployed anywhere on top of the template.  Summoned packs may make assault moves as normal on the turn they appear.
&gt;Corrupted: Although Khorne Space Marines were once true Space Marines, they have long since forsaken the ideals and aspirations of the Defenders of Humanity.  They do not receive the benefit of the “And They Shall Know No Fear” ability which applies to Space Marines who remain loyal to the Emperor.
&gt; ARMORY
&gt;Khorne's Champions may pick up to two single-handed weapons from the list below. In addition, each character may be given up to 150 points worth of items of wargear, unless otherwise noted in their army list entry. You may not take duplicate items of wargear for the same model.  Items marked with an asterisk (*) are the only ones able to be taken by models in Terminator Armor.  Vehicle upgrades marked with a double asterisk (**) are the only ones allowed to be used by dreadnoughts.

&gt; BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD! ARMY LIST
&gt;HQ
&gt;0-1 LORD OF KHORNE
&gt;	Pts/model	WS	BS	S	T	W	I	A	Ld	Save
&gt;Exalted Champion	70	5	5	5	4	3	5	3	10	3+
&gt;Mighty Champion	55	5	5	5	4	2	5	3	10	3+
&gt;Options: The Lord of Khorne may take any equipment from the Armory.
&gt;SPECIAL RULES
&gt;Independent Character: The Lord of Khorne is an Independent Character and follows the independent character special rules in the Warhammer 40,000 rulebook.
&gt;Fearless:  The Lord of Khorne is truly only at home on the battlefield.  Khorne cares not from where the blood flows, so the Lord’s life holds little value.  He is considered Fearless, will never fall back, cannot be pinned, and automatically passes any leadership-based test that he is required to make.
&gt;Retinue: A Retinue of his finest warriors may accompany The Lord of Khorne.
&gt;Squad: The squad consists of between five and nine Khorne Berserkers.  If the Lord of Khorne is in Terminator Armor, then the retinue may consist of Berserker Terminators instead of standard Berserkers.  If the Lord of Khorne has been gifted with a Juggernaut, then the retinue may consist of Bloodcrushers instead of standard Berserkers.
&gt;The cost of the Retinue is taken from the relevant squad choice.
&gt;Weapons: See the relevant squad choice.
&gt;Options: The standard options available to the chosen squad type are available to the Retinue.  However, any number of members of the Retinue may be upgraded to Aspiring Champions, rather than just one, as is normally the case.
&gt;One Aspiring Champion in the Retinue may become an Icon Bearer and may carry a Khornate Icon chosen from the Armory at the additional cost listed there
&gt;Trusted servants of Khorne, the officers of the World Eaters and the other legions are held personally responsible for the bloodshed carried out in his name.  They are expected to set an example to their underlings by carrying the fight into the heart of the enemy.
&gt;0-1 DAEMON PRINCE OF KHORNE
&gt;	Pts/model	WS	BS	S	T	W	I	A	Ld	Save
&gt;Daemon Prince	90	6	0	6	4	3	5	3	10	5+
&gt;Weapons: All Daemon Princes are armed with a variety of weapons with which to slay their mortal enemies.  Typically these are huge axes, magical swords, or enchanted whips, but can also take many other forms.  The benefits for carrying these weapons are already included in the Daemon Prince’s profile.
&gt;Options: The Daemon Prince may be upgraded with any number of the following: Wings for +10 points; an Axe of Khorne for +5 points; a Whip of Khorne for +10 points; a Collar of Khorne for +30 points; or Chaos Armor for +40 points (granting a 2+ Armor Save which may be taken instead of his 5+ Invulnerable Save for each wound suffered.  A weapon with an AP of 2 or lower can cancel it as normal, in which case the 5+ Invulnerable Save would still apply.) 
&gt;SPECIAL RULES
&gt;Independent Character: The Daemon Prince is an independent character and follows all of the Independent Character special rules as given in the Warhammer 40,000 rulebook.
&gt;Fearless: Daemon Princes never fall back and cannot be pinned.  They are assumed to automatically pass any Morale Check.
&gt;Monstrous Creature: The Daemon Prince is a huge and terribly strong opponent.  It is treated as a Monsterous Creature and therefore rolls 2D6 for armor penetration and ignores armor saves in close combat.
&gt;Invulnerable: A Daemon Prince is an unnatural creature made from the very stuff of Chaos itself and is therefore very difficult to destroy.  It is treated as being Invulnerable and may make an armor save against any and all wounds it takes, even those that would normally pierce it's armor or that allow no save to be made. Note that this save is on a 5+ and remains so even if the Chaos Armor upgrade is bought for the daemon.
&gt;Daemon Princes are among the most exalted of Khorne’s followers: mortals who have been elevated to Daemonhood.  Their particular savagery reflects their humble origins.
&gt;KHORNE RENEGADES
&gt;	Pts/model	WS	BS	S	T	W	I	A	Ld	Save
&gt;Renegade	55	5	5	5	4	1	4	3	10	3+/5+
&gt;Number: You may include one to three Renegades as a single HQ choice.
&gt;Weapons: Bolt pistol and close combat weapon
&gt;Options:  A Renegade of Khorne may be equipped with any equipment from the Armory.
&gt;SPECIAL RULES
&gt;Lone Character: Renegades follow all of the rules concerning Independent Characters from the Warhammer 40,000 rulebook.  However, they may never be joined up with other units and always fight on their own.  The only exception is that they may lead units of Possessed or Chaos Hounds.  This does not stop them from using their proximity to friendly units to make them more difficult to hit by enemy shooting attacks.
&gt;Fearless: A Renegade knows nothing but war, and even that holds no surprises.  They are considered Fearless, never fall back, cannot be pinned, and always are assumed to pass all leadership-based tests that they are called upon to make.
&gt;Curse of the Eternal Warriors: A Renegade has been gifted by Khorne with supernatural immunity, granting him with an Invulnerable 5+ save that may be taken instead of his normal 3+ Power Armor save.  Improving a Renegade’s Power Armor with Wargear simply changes his 3+ save to the appropriate new one, and all effects of the new armor still apply.
&gt;The Renegade Slayers of Khorne are the lost warriors, fighting without a legion.  Cursed to wander alone through the Eye of Terror, to occasionally join up with a Khorne Warband or crusade, slaughter, and live to fight another day.  Whether they are simply the last remaining Marines from a decimated chapter, or if they renounced their fellows and went off to kill undisturbed, it doesn’t matter.  They are often the most rewarded of Khorne’s followers, since mindless, soulless killing in the Blood God’s name is the best worship of all.
&gt; 
&gt;BLOODTHIRSTER OF KHORNE
&gt;	Pts/model	WS	BS	S	T	W	I	A	Ld	Save
&gt;Bloodthirster	140	9	0	8	6	4	4	5	10	5+
&gt;Options: Some Bloodthirsters wear ornate Chaos Armor, forged in the furnaces of the daemon worlds, and quenched in the blood of Khorne’s enemies.  For an additional 40 points, a Greater Daemon of Khorne may be given Chaos Armor, granting a 2+ Armor Save which may be used instead of the daemon’s 5+ Invulnerable Save for each wound suffered (decide before rolling the save).  A Bloodthirster may be gifted with an Axe of Khorne for +5 points, and/or a Whip of Khorne for +10 points.
&gt;SPECIAL RULES
&gt;Possession:  A Bloodthirster must possess another model in order to enter the battlefield.
&gt;At the start of the Chaos Player's second and subsequent turns, you must test to determine if the Bloodthirster successfully possesses a model in Khorne's Legion.  If there are any units in the Legion numbering 8 strong, or a multiple thereof, the Bloodthirster possesses a model in one of those units on a D6 roll of 4+.  If successful, choose any model in the unit and replace it with the Bloodthirster.  If unsuccessful, or if there isn't a unit with Khorne's Sacred Number of models, nominate one of Khorne's Champions, and that model is possessed on a D6 roll of 6, and the Champion is destroyed, replaced by the Bloodthirster.  If the Daemon is not summoned, continue choosing Champions until either the Bloodthirster is brought to life, or there are no more Champions to test.  Note that all Champions must be rolled for.
&gt;Independent Character: The Bloodthirster is an independent character and follows all of the Independent Character special rules as given in the Warhammer 40,000 rulebook.
&gt;Fearsome: If the Bloodthirster wins an insult their opponents automatically have to fall back without a Morale check being taken.  Opponents that never fall back or ignore Morale checks ignore this effect and will not fall back. 
&gt;Fearless: Bloodthirsters never fall back and cannot be pinned.  They are assumed to automatically pass any Morale Check.
&gt;Monstrous Creature: The Bloodthirster is a huge and terribly strong opponent.  It is treated as a Monstrous Creature and therefore rolls 2D6 for armor penetration and ignores armor saves in close combat.
&gt;Invulnerable: A Daemon Prince is an unnatural creature made from the very stuff of Chaos itself and is therefore very difficult to destroy.  It is treated as being Invulnerable and may make an armor save against any and all wounds it takes, even those that would normally pierce it's armor or that allow no save to be made.  Note that this save is on a 5+ and remains so even if the Chaos Armor upgrade is bought for the daemon.
&gt;Wings: The Bloodthirster has wings.  This allows it to make a 12&quot; assault move, ignoring any intervening terrain between them and the target.
&gt;The Bloodthirsters are the most favored servants of Khorne.  They exist purely for combat and combat alone.  Their bloodlust extends far beyond mortal comprehension, and they will attack everything within their reach with terrible ferocity.  They do not know fear, other than of Khorne, and act regardless of the cost or consequence, although the usual consequences are death for whoever or whatever they face.  Their immense pride in their fighting abilities rarely permits them to call upon allies or servants, and they usually rely only upon their own strength and skill.
&gt; ELITES
&gt;BERSERKER TERMINATORS
&gt;	Pts/model	WS	BS	S	T	W	I	A	Ld	Save
&gt;Berserker Terminators	56	4	4	5	4	1	4	2	10	2+
&gt;Number: A Berserker Terminator Squad consists of between five and ten Berserker Terminators
&gt;Weapons: Combi-bolter & power weapon.
&gt;Options: Up to two Berserker Terminators can be armed with an autocannon at +20 points or a heavy flamer at +15 points.  Any model may upgrade their combi-bolter to a combi-flamer at +2 pts or a combi-meltagun at +3 points.  The power weapon may be upgraded to a power fist or lightning claw at +5 points, or a chainfist at +8 points.  Any model may trade in both the combi-bolter & power weapon for a pair of lightning claws for +5 points.
&gt;Up to one model may be upgraded to an Aspiring Champion for no additional cost.  The Aspiring Champion has the same profile as the rest of the squad but may be given any additional equipment allowed from the Armoury.
&gt;SPECIAL RULES
&gt;Deep Strike: In the right circumstances, Berserker Terminators can teleport into battle, appearing almost anywhere on the battlefield.  To represent this they may set up using the Deep Strike rules, but only if the mission allows them to be used.  If it does not then the Terminators must set up normally with the rest of the army.
&gt;Terminators: A number of special rules apply to Chaos Terminators.  See the Terminator Armor entry in the Wargear section for details.
&gt;Fearless:  Berserker Terminators are insane madmen, and are thereby considered Fearless.  They will never fall back, cannot be pinned, and are assumed to automatically pass any Leadership-based test that they are required to make.
&gt;Regardless of whether they were originally members of a Traitor Legion First Company, or if they have been turned to chaos over the centuries, those Chaos Marines Terminators marked by the Blood God are indeed mighty amongst the best troops in the galaxy.  Armed with a devastating array of close combat weapons, they can completely demolish a heavily armored vehicle or a large unit of enemy in a matter of seconds.
&gt;0-1 UNIT OF BLOODCRUSHERS
&gt;	Pts/model	WS	BS	S	T	W	I	A	Ld	Save
&gt;Bloodcrushers	50	4	4	4	6	2	4	4	10	3+
&gt;Aspiring Champion	+20	4	4	5	6	2	4	5	10	3+
&gt;Number: A Bloodcrusher Squad consists of between one and ten Khorne Berserkers riding Juggernauts (bonuses included in profile)
&gt;Weapons: Bolt pistol & close combat weapon.
&gt;Options:  Up to half of the models may upgrade their bolt pistol for a plasma pistol at +6 points.  Up to half of the models may upgrade their close combat weapon for a power weapon for +15 points.  One model may upgrade both his bolt pistol and close combat weapon for a pair of lightning claws at +15 points.  The unit may be given Frag grenades for +1 point per model.  The unit may be given Krak grenades for +3 points per model.
&gt;Up to one model may be upgraded to an Aspiring Champion at an additional cost of +20 points.  The Bloodcrusher Aspiring Champion is equipped with a bolt pistol & close combat weapon, and rides into battle on a Juggernaut (bonuses included in profile).  He may be given any additional equipment allowed from the Armoury.  The Aspiring Champion may not be given Terminator Armor.
&gt;SPECIAL RULES
&gt;Fearless:  Even before Khorne blessed the Bloodcrushers with the reward of Juggernaut mounts, they were some of his finest warriors.  They were Berserkers, are thereby considered Fearless.  They will never fall back, cannot be pinned, and are assumed to automatically pass any Leadership-based test that they are required to make.
&gt;And so it was that a single squad of Khorne’s Warriors slew a hundred times their number, suffering not a casualty amongst them.  When the fortress’s defenders were all silent and their skulls were adorning the Blood God’s throne, the Berserkers were led by a vision to proceed into the courtyard, where they found their master’s rewards; a pack of Khorne’s Juggernauts.  Just as each member of the squad chose his prize of living blood and iron, the proximity sensors drew their attention to the skies where the sight of Imperial Drop Pods could just be seen entering the atmosphere.  The defenders’ reinforcements had arrived; there would be more skulls for the throne of Khorne before the day was through!
&gt;POSSESSED BY BLOODLETTERS
&gt;	Pts/model	WS	BS	S	T	W	I	A	Ld	Save
&gt;Possessed	30	4	4	5	4	1	4	1	9	3+
&gt;Possessed Champion	+15	4	4	5	4	1	4	2	10	3+
&gt;Number: A Squad of Possessed Marines consists of between five and ten members.
&gt;Weapons: Bolt pistol and close combat weapon.
&gt;Rhino:  The entire squad may be mounted in a Rhino armored carrier at an additional cost of +50 points.
&gt;Options: Up to one model may be upgraded to an Aspiring Champion at an additional cost of +15 points.  The Aspiring Champion may not take any additional equipment, but counts as a character when determining Greater Daemon Possession.  Any Possessed squad containing an Aspiring Champion may re-roll one of its dice when rolling on the Possessed by Bloodletters chart.  The second result must be taken or it has no effect if it is a duplicate.
&gt;SPECIAL RULES
&gt;Fearless:  If a Chaos Space Marine has given his body over to one of Khorne’s Bloodletters, emotion no longer holds any meaning, and he becomes Fearless.  He cannot be pinned, automatically passes any leadership based tests that he is required to make, and will never fall back.
&gt;Possessed by Bloodletters: Roll twice on the table below at the start of the battle to find out what effects the daemons have on the bodies of the troopers in the squad.  Any duplicate rolls have no effect and are lost.
&gt;1 Insanely Fast.  Models in the squad move 12” in the movement phase instead of 6”.  They still only have an assault move of 6”.
&gt;2 Visage of Khorne.  They are treated as being Fearsome.  If the squad wins an assault their opponents automatically have to fall back, without a Morale Check being taken.   Opponents that never fall back or that ignore Morale Checks are not effected and will remain in combat.
&gt;3 Berserk.  All of the models in the squad were previously Khorne Berserkers, and have +1 Attack.
&gt;4 Hellblades.  No armor saves are allowed against close combat attacks made by models in the squad.

&gt;6 No effect.
&gt;Drawn by martial prowess and mindless killing, the daemons of Khorne often attempt to overtake the body of one devoted to Chaos.  After a battle of wills, the host eventually succumbs, and allows the power of the daemon to transform his body into a horrible visage of destruction.  The whole is more viscous than the sum of its parts.

&gt;Summoned:  Daemons are summoned onto the battlefield as described in Codex: Chaos Space Marines.
&gt;And to tell of his Beast: the like of it has never been seen.  He came upon a mighty steed of groaning iron and brazen steel, a thing of living metal that stood taller than a man and roared with all the furies of a thousand dead.  He sat securely proud in a deep saddle that grew out the very back of this accursed Beast, it’s high posts framing a massive head, part hound, part bull, part the incarnate soul of bloody hate.  As it came toward us we saw its thousand close-riveted plates, forged in dark fires and bound with runes.  Its breath was fear and its every step a thundering knell of doom.  As it bared its brazen, gore-speckled fangs, we lost all heart and turned, fleeing to the safety of the night and terrors still unseen.

&gt;Monsterous:  Attacks from a Bloodslaughterer in close combat ignore armor, and they roll 2D6 + strength vs. vehicle armor.
&gt;Fearless:  The Bloodslaughterer is a Daemonic War Engine, possessed by a Khorne Bloodletter.  It knows no emotions other than rage and the pleasure of the slaughter of its foe.  It is considered Fearless.  It cannot be pinned, never falls back, and always makes any leadership-based test that it is required to make.
&gt;One of the more plentiful of Khorne’s Daemon Engines, the Bloodslaughterer epitomes Khorne’s approach to warfare.

&gt;Options: Up to three Khorne Destructors may have one of the following weapons: missile launcher at +20 points; autocannon at +20 points; heavy bolter at +15 points; or lascannon at +35 points.
&gt;One of the Destructors may be upgraded to an Aspiring Champion for an additional +20 points.  The Champion may be equipped with any additional equipment from the Khorne Armory.
&gt;SPECIAL RULES
&gt;Fire Lust: In every shooting phase where any member of the Destructor squad does not fire his weapon for any reason, roll a D6 for each member who did not fire.
&gt;1-5: 	No effect
&gt;	6:	Blood for the Blood God!  The Destructor flies into a rage, unleashing his weapon without discrimination.  He immediately fires his weapon at the nearest unit, friend or foe, regardless of any other circumstances (moving while carrying a heavy weapon, etc.).  If more than one unit is the same distance away, the Khorne player may choose, normal targeting rules apply.  If the target unit is a Khorne unit, then the opposing player gets to position any blast markers.
&gt;When a warrior chooses the path of Khorne, they do not all desire hand-to-hand combat.  Khorne cares not from whence the blood flows!  The Destructors take their heavy weapons into battle to rain death, plain and simple.  If they are unable to kill enough for their taste, they turn their guns onto the closest target, to collect more skulls for the Throne of Khorne.
&gt;MINOTAUR

&gt;Minotaur	25	4	2	5	4	3	3	2	9	6+
&gt;Number:  A Minotaur pack consists of from three to ten models.
&gt;Weapons: Close combat weapon.
&gt;Options:  Any number of Minotaurs may purchase an additional close combat weapon for +5 points.  Any model may upgrade his close combat weapon for a two-handed weapon for +3 points (roll 2D6 + strength vs. vehicle armor).  One model may trade in its close combat weapon for a heavy flamer for +12 points.  One model may trade in its close combat weapon for an autocannon for +8 points.  One model may trade in its close combat weapon for a heavy bolter for +5 points. 
&gt;SPECIAL RULES
&gt;Huge: A Minotaur is an incredibly large creature, and is not daunted by the firing of high caliber weaponry.  Therefore all weapons are considered to be Assault instead of Heavy when fired by a Minotaur.  This is not as advantageous as it may at first seem, due to the inaccuracy of the shots.  Any Assault weapons remain Assault.
&gt;Blood Greed: A Minotaur pack only rolls 1D6 to determine it’s follow-up distance when pursuing a defeated enemy, as they are too busy eating the bodies of their victims.  They may consolidate 6” as normal.  If the Minotaur pack catches and destroys the fleeing unit, they then become subject to the rules for Fearless (never fall back, cannot be pinned, automatically pass any leadership-based test) and may pursue 2D6 inches as normal for the remainder of the battle.
&gt;With an insatiable appetite for fresh blood, Minotaurs are naturally drawn to the service of Khorne.  Their lust for battle is sometimes overshadowed by their carnivorous nature, as their Blood Greed often distracts them from further battle as they quench their thirst on the flesh of their current victims.
&gt;KHORNE DREADNOUGHT

&gt;Khorne Dreadnought	75	4	4	6(10)	12	12	10	4	3

&gt;Weapons:  The Chaos Dreadnought is armed with a Dreadnought  close combat weapon incorporating a twin-linked bolter in one arm and one weapon from the following list in the other: twin-linked autocannon at +35 points; twin-linked lascannon at +50 points; twin-linked heavy bolter at +30 points; multi-melta at +40 points; plasma cannon at +40 points.
&gt;Options: The twin-linked bolter may be upgraded to a heavy flamer at an extra cost of +12 points.  The Dreadnought may replace its close combat weapon with a missile launcher at an extra cost of +10 points but its attacks are reduced to 2 if it does.  The Dreadnought may be equipped with any of the dreadnought-allowed vehicle upgrades from the Blood for the Blood God! Armory.
&gt;SPECIAL RULES
&gt;Fire Frenzy: Being in battle drives the Chaos Space Marine Dreadnoughts into a state of insane rage.   At times this will cause them to charge ferociously and lash out with their weaponry like blood-mad berserkers at other times to blaze away randomly at imaginary foes.  To represent this, roll a D6 before shooting with the Dreadnought and refer to the table below.
&gt;1	Blood Rage!  Instead of shooting the Dreadnought moves D6” towards the nearest enemy, only stopping if it moves within 1” of an enemy model.  If this takes it within 6” of the enemy it must charge in the Assault Phase, but it doubles its Attacks characteristic in that Assault Phase (i.e., it counts as having an attacks characteristic of 6 rather than 3).  If the Dreadnought has been Immobilized count this result as a roll of 6 instead.
&gt;2-5	Shoot normally
&gt;6	Fire Frenzy!  The Dreadnought must fire all of its weapons twice, but may not move in the Assault Phase.  Roll to hit for all of the shooting attacks.  Then allocate each hit to a separate model, starting at the closest model to the Dreadnough (friend or foe) and then moving progressively further away.  Models in close combat may be shot at!  The Chaos player may choose what order he allocated the hits that were scored.  If you run out of targets then any further hits are wasted.  If the Dreadnought is in base contact with an enemy model count this result as a roll of 1 instead.
&gt;With the body of one of Khorne’s Champions entombed inside, a Dreadnought becomes an insane machination of destruction.  Nearly uncontrollable, they are unleashed only in times of battle.

&gt;The backbone of a Chaos Space Marine force, the Predator Tank is often customized by the Chaos Squats who maintain Khorne’s Daemon Engines.

&gt;Transport:  The Chaos Land Raider can carry up to ten Chaos Space Marines or five Berserker Terminators.
&gt;The Chaos Land Raider is a multi-function vehicle.  Capable of transporting even the devastating Berserker Terminators, and providing fire support in quantity difficult to find in a Khorne Warhost, these vehicles are often found on the battlefields even within the Eye of Terror.

&gt;Khârn the Betrayer	189	7	5	5	4	4	7	4(5)	10	2+
&gt;A Blood for the Blood God! Army may include Khârn.  See his Special Rule, Outcast Leader.  He may only be used in a battle where both players have agreed to the use of Special Characters. Khârn must be taken exactly as detailed below, and may not be given any additional Wargear from the Armory.
&gt;Wargear:  Plasma pistol, bolt pistol, frag & krak grenades, Chaos Armor, Gorechild, Collar of Khorne.
&gt;SPECIAL RULES
&gt;Outcast Leader: Khârn counts as one HQ choice.  If it is desired that he lead the army, then he counts as a Khorne Lord for the “There can be only one” rule, and operates as an Independent Character, following all rules from the 40k rulebook.  If he does not lead the army, he then is on the battle as a Renegade, and doesn’t count as a Khorne Lord.  He then is subject to the Lone Character Special Rule from the Khorne Renegades list entry.  No other Khorne Renegade Special Rules apply.
&gt;Furious Charge: Such is Khârn’s ferocious enthusiasm to get to grips with the enemy that he may add +D6” to his move in the Assault Phase.  However, he can only use this bonus if it will actually get him into hand-to-hand combat that turn and it may not be used if he can not reach the enemy.
&gt;Gorechild: Khârn’s huge and ancient chain-axe, Gorechild, is an artifact from the Great Crusade when the Space Marines reaved across the galaxy.  Gorechild’s jagged whirring teeth were torn from the jaws of mica-dragons on Luther Mcintyre, its haft is forged from adamantium and its head is a full three span across.  It is a deadly weapon capable of splitting an armoured Space Marine from head to crotch with one blow and is doubly dangerous in the hands of Khârn.  He is so skilled with Gorechild that in hand-to-hand combat the enemy’s WS is ignored and all his close combat attacks always hit on a roll of 2+.  This aside, Gorechild is treated as a normal power weapon.
&gt;The Betrayer: Khârn may attack anyone nearby in his berserk fury, friend or for alike!  To represent this, roll to hit, but then each player takes it in turn to distribute the hits, starting with the Chaos player (ie, the Chaos player allocates and works out the effect of the first hit, his opponent allocates and works out the effect of the second hit, and so on).  The normal restrictions for allocating hits apply, so they must be allocated against models in base contact with Khârn first, then on models within 2” of him if all models in base contact are slain.  Within these restrictions a hit may be allocated against any model, including Chaos models, so it makes sense for the Chaos player to keep Khârn as far away from models on his own side as possible.
&gt;Fearless: Khârn is completely Fearless and automatically passes and Leadersip-based tests he is called upon to make.  In addition he cannot be pinned by enemy fire.
&gt;Khârn has dedicated his millennia-long existence to unleashing bloody carnage upon anyone and anything within reach.  He is drawn by the scent of war as a hungering hound is drawn by fresh meat and it has become impossible to tally his slaying.  Even in the Great Crusade when he fought in the assault companies of the World Eaters Legion he was known to be a brilliant but unstable warrior.  Indeed, the whole World Eaters Legion was viewed as excessively bloodthirsty and dangerously over-zealous in the suppression of planets that had not even defied the Emperor’s will.  When the Heresy came Khârn gladly led his warriors against his brother Marines, most notoriously in the drop site massacres of Istvaan V.

&gt;Doombreed may be taken as a HQ choice in a Blood for the Blood God! Army if Special Characters has been agreed upon.  See also his special rule, Arrogant.  Doombreed must be taken exactly as detailed below, and may not be given any additional equipment from the Armory.
&gt;Wargear:  Doombreed is armed with an Axe of Khorne and a Rod of Khorne.  He wears Chaos Armor (2+ armor save, may be used instead of the 5+ demonic Invulnerable save), a Collar of Khorne, and has Wings.
&gt;SPECIAL RULES
&gt;Daemon Prince: Doombreed is a Daemon Prince, and thereby follows all of the special rules for them, including Independent Character, Fearless, Monstrous Creature, and Invulnerable.
&gt;Radiance of Dark Glory: A more intimidating commander than Doombreed does not exist in the 41st Millennium.  No one dare fail him.  All models within 12” of Doombreed and in his line-of-sight are considered Fearless.
&gt;Arrogant: If Doombreed is included in the army, then none of the other HQ choices may be a Daemon Prince or a Lord.  This rule still applies even if playing a large game with multiple detachments.
&gt;Scourge of Slaanesh: As an impassioned enemy of the God of Pleasure, Doombreed may re-roll one To Hit roll per round of close combat when fighting against any Slaaneshi Daemons, Noise Marines, or Characters with the Mark of Slaanesh.
&gt;Khorne was the first of the great Chaos Gods to awake fully, and Doombreed was one of the first of his servants.  His true name has long been forgotten, but he was once human, a mighty Warlord who led armies which ravaged entire nations on Earth long, long ago.  His acts of genocide and murder pleased the young god Khorne, who rewarded him and made him one of his Daemon Princes.
&gt;Since then Doombreed has continued to serve Khorne well.  He fought for his master at the side of Horus during the Heresy, and was aboard the Warmaster’s battle barge when Horus was slain and the Emperor mortally wounded.  Over the millennia he has returned to plague humanity countless times.

&gt;A Blood for the Blood God! Army may include the Captain of the Chosen Company in the army as one of the HQ choices as long as Special Characters have been agreed to be taken.  Caramon does not count as a Chaos Lord when applying the “There can be only one” rule, as he rarely makes his presence known until the battle is already underway. Caramon must be taken exactly as detailed below, and may not be given any additional equipment from the Armory.
&gt;Wargear:  Caramon is armed with a Hellblade (counts as a Master-crafted power weapon), a bolt gun, krak & frag grenades
&gt;SPECIAL RULES
&gt;Visage of Bloodletter: Caramon has been gifted with the ability to partially transform himself into a daemon of Khorne, which he refrains from doing until the moment he enters close combat.  His gains the head of a Bloodletter, becoming Fearsome (all enemies beaten in close combat automatically fall back).  His demonic attributes causes his armor save to be treated as Invulnerable. 
&gt;Captain of The Chosen Company: Caramon is not deployed at the beginning of the battle.  Instead, when one of the units in the army becomes The Chosen Company, choose any one of the models in the unit and replace him with Caramon.  Note that most likely this will be a model that has assaulted into close combat.  The model replaced is not considered slain, as it was simply Caramon to begin with, and his point value has been adjusted to take that into account.  
&gt;The appearance of the Chosen Company is one of the most perplexing aspects of war with the Blood God. It is an eternal mystery how Caramon and his company always are the first unit in hand to hand.  If the captain knows, he has never revealed the reason.  It is rumored that a Lord of Khorne once was determined to investigate the Chosen Company, whether it was to understand their methods or to eliminate the annoying warriors is not known.   He carefully inspected all of his troops before battle.  Unable to find any trace of Caramon or his brethren, the Lord plunged into combat against some wretched Slaaneshi demonic hosts.  The slaughter was satisfying, and it was at his utmost amazement when he realized that Caramon the Rabid was slaying at his side!  His hand-selected retinue, his finest warriors, had been all from the Chosen!  From that point onward, the Lord forgot about his obsession with the Chosen Company, for he realized that the plans of Khorne are often beyond the minds of men.

&gt;Techra	85	4(6)	4	5(10)	4	1	4	2(3)	10	2+
&gt;A Blood for the Blood God! Army may include Techra, the Berserker Terminator Sergeant, in the army as a member of a Berserker Terminator Squad, replacing the Aspiring Champion, only if the taking of Special Characters has been agreed upon before hand.  Techra must be taken exactly as detailed below, and may not be given any additional equipment from the Armory.
&gt;Wargear:  Techra is armed with two close combat weapons: The Daemon Weapon Bloodblade and a chain fist. 
&gt;SPECIAL RULES
&gt;Bloodblade, Daemon Weapon: The spirit of a Greater Daemon of Khorne is bound within a huge axe, called Bloodblade, and wielded by a Sergeant of the World Eater First Company, Techra.  It has all of the normal properties of an Axe of Khorne.  Additionally, it grants Techra 2 extra points of Weapon Skill, and the ability to automatically kill any model successfully wounded by Bloodblade if the wounding die roll was a 6 regardless of the victim’s toughness, as if effected by Instant Death!  Any unit suffering casualties from Bloodblade are always considered to have been beaten in close combat, and if that casualty suffered from the Instant Death! Rule above, then the unit is considered to be outnumbered by at least 2:1.
&gt;Multiple close combat weapons: Since Techra is equipped with two different close combat weapons, both with special effects, he must chose which weapon he is attacking with at the beginning of each close combat round.  He receives the +1 attack bonus for having two close combat weapons (not included on his profile), but the +2WS and the Instant Death! Rule only if he attacks with the Daemon Weapon.
&gt;Death or Glory!:  When being Tank Shocked, and choosing the Death or Glory! Option, Techra may make two attempts to destroy the vehicle using his chain fist, as he has no ranged weapons.  If he fails to destroy the vehicle, he is killed as normal.
&gt;Dangerous Possession: If a Bloodthirster successfully possesses Techra, roll another D6.  If the roll is anything other than another 6, Techra wards away the Greater Daemon and it is considered destroyed in terms of Victory Points.
&gt;Berserker Terminator: Techra is subject to all the special rules for Berserker Terminators, including Fearless, Deep Strike, and Terminator Armor.
&gt;Techra had fallen thousands of years ago with his Lord Angron.  As a sergeant of the First Company, he wore ancient and powerful Tactical Dreadnought Armor, and was equipped with a chain fist against which even the thickest of armor offered little protection.   It was due solely to his leadership that his close-knit squad of Terminators remained together after the disintegration of the World Eaters Legion.  Upon the field of battle, no one was more disciplined in his slaughter, or more in control with the precise application of his blind rage, and the others followed his example.  Between battles, he maintained order by instituting elaborate rituals of martial purity.  
&gt;Once, as he was preparing the pre-combat blood rites that his squad would undertake, he felt an overwhelming presence as one of Khorne’s Bloodthirsters attempted to use his flesh to anchor his appearance in the material world.  Not willing to relinquish his life so that a daemon would be able to exist, Techra fought back.  Reciting ancient, forgotten incantations and exerting all of his mental energy, the sergeant allowed the beast’s axe to materialize in his hand, but forced the life essence of the daemon into the weapon.  He bound it with runes and bloodstone, and named the axe “Bloodblade”.  With it, Techra has killed thousands in Khorne’s name.  It is told that the only thing worse than suffering a bite from the Daemon Weapon is to watch a comrade be slain by it.  When the weapon is quenched in a victim’s blood Techra’s runes are no longer able to contain the daemon trapped inside, and the Bloodthirster lashes out, rending its victim in a vision of eternal hate that drives all that glimpse of it mad.
&gt;T’SAN TAS, BLOODTHIRSTER OF KHORNE
&gt;	Points	WS	BS	S	T	W	I	A	Ld	Save
&gt;T’San Tas	220	9	0	8	6	4	4(7)	5(6)	10	2+/5+
&gt;T’San Tas may only be included as a HQ choice when the taking of Special Characters has been agreed upon by both players.  T’San Tas must be taken exactly as detailed below, and may not be given any additional equipment from the Armory.
&gt;Wargear:  T’San Tas is a favored servant of Khorne, and has been gifted with Chaos Armor (2+ armor save, may be used instead of the 5+ demonic Invulnerable save), Axe of Khorne, and Whip of Khorne.
&gt;SPECIAL RULES
&gt;Bloodthirster:  T’San Tas is a Bloodthirster, and is subject to all of the special rules concerning Greater Daemons, with the exception of his unique Summoning rules, below.
&gt;Summoning: When summoned onto the battlefield, T’San Tas tears at the very fabric of reality, rending the souls of all mortals in the immediate area.  If the bloodshed is not sufficient for his taste, he will refuse to appear.  At the beginning of the Chaos player’s second and subsequent turns, you must attempt to summon T’San Tas.  Nominate any character in the Chaos army.  On a D6 roll of 4+, the character has drawn the attention of the Greater Daemon.  Center the Ordinance template on the character.  Every living model (Wraithlords, Wraithguard, Talos, Avatars, other daemons, Necrons, and all other non-living creatures are immune) touched by the template takes a wound on a 4+ with armor saves as normal, including the character and other friendly models.  If this attack is sufficient to cause 3 or more wounds, then remove the character and replace with T’San Tas.  If it is not sufficient, then T’San Tas will not appear this turn.  Do not proceed to the next character.  Note that it is quite possible for a Champion to be killed attempting to summon the Greater Daemon and not having been successful.
&gt;The Greater Daemon, T’San Tas, has been the scourge of Khorne’s enemies for centuries.  Even more frightening is his desire to slaughter even those already fighting in the Blood God’s name.  Described as having the head of a Juggernaut and huge ram’s horns, many a Chaos Space Marine general has regretted calling on his services as he tears apart an entire unit of Berserkers before making his entry onto the field of battle.
&gt; BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD! WARGEAR
&gt;Axe of Khorne: The model is gifted with a mighty Axe of Khorne, suffused with chaotic power and laden with death!  A hit from the Axe of Khorne ignores armor saves.  In addition, any to hit rolls of 6 allow the model to make an additional attack in close combat.  As long as you keep on rolling 6s you can keep on making additional attacks.  These additional attacks may be allocated against new opponents if desired.
&gt;Banner of Rage: The Banner of Rage contains the bound souls of the most bloodthirsty of Khorne’s servants.  It radiates palpable waves of anger and lust for slaughter that beat upon the minds of those near it, driving them into a killing frenzy.  The banner may be used once per battle, in any assault phase (including your opponents).  Any models from the Chaos army that are within 2D6” of the standard may add +1 to their strength characteristic.
&gt;Bionics:  If a model with bionics is killed, instead of removing it, place the model on its side.  Roll a D6 at the start of the next turn: on a roll of a 6 the model is stood back up with 1 wound, but on any other roll it is removed as a casualty.
&gt;Chain fist: A chain fist is simply a power fist fitted with an attachment designed to carve through armored bulkheads or armored vehicles.  It is treated as a power fist, but 2D6 are rolled for armor penetration.
&gt;Chaos Armor: Magically enhanced by the god of war, Chaos Armor may be taken as an upgrade for a model wearing power armor, increasing the save to 2+.  Note that although Chaos Armor gives the same protection as Terminator Armor, items that are “Terminator Only” may not be used with it.  If worn by a Daemon Prince or Bloodthirster, the 2+ save may be used instead of the model’s Invulnerable save if the wound would normally allow armor saves to be taken.
&gt;Chaos Icon: This powerful Daemonic standard is surrounded by potent spells of summoning.  At the start of the battle, nominate one unit that must be summoned to be enslaved to the Icon.  At the start of any Chaos turn, this unit can be automatically summoned – no roll to summon or scatter is required, simply place the Daemonic unit within 6” of the Icon.  The unit can move in the movement phase and may make assaults as normal.
&gt;Chaos Space Marine Bike: Riding a bike increases a Khorne Space Marine’s Toughness by +1.  The bike is generally fitted with twin-linked bolters, but these can be upgraded to a meltagun or a flamer at an additional cost of +10 points each.  Characters that have a retinue or are otherwise part of a unit may only be given a bike if all of the models in the unit also have bikes.  Chaos Space Marine bikes are fitted with scythes and blades which add +1 to the rider’s Attacks characteristics.
&gt;Collar of Khorne: The Collar of Khorne that hangs around the model’s neck is said to be forged from the heat of Khorne’s rage at the very foot of the Blood God’s throne of brass.  The collar is able to suck the energy of the warp from around it, fortifying the wearer and also protecting it from psychic attack.  As a result, force weapons lose their special ability to kill the wearer outright, and psychic powers that target the wearer or include him in their area of effect are nullified and will not work on a D6 roll of 2+.
&gt;Juggernaut of Khorne: A model mounted on a Juggernaut gains +2 Toughness and +2 Attacks.  Models in Terminator Armor, wearing Jump packs, having Wings, or riding a Chaos Space Marine Bike may not be mounted on a Juggernaut.  Note that models mounted on Juggernauts do not count as cavalry – Juggernauts are not noted for their speed!
&gt;Jump Packs: Models wearing jump packs can move 12” per turn in the movement phase and can ignore difficult terrain as they move.  Models that are part of a unit may only be given a jump pack if all the models in the unit have jump packs.  Models wearing Terminator Armor or riding a bike may not be given jump packs.  Chaos Space Marine models equipped with jump packs can be dropped from low flying Doomlord attack craft and use their jump paks to swoop down on to the battlefield.   To represent this tactic they can setup using Deep Strike rules, but only if the mission allows for Deep Strike to be used.  If the mission does not allows troops to use these rules, then the model must be set up normally with the rest of the army.
&gt;Lightning claw: Lightning claws count as a power weapon.  In addition the model may re-roll any To Wound rolls that fail to wound.  Models armed with a lightning claw only receive the +1 Attack modifier for an additional close combat weapon if the second weapon is also a lightning claw.  Because of this, lightning claws are often used in pairs.
&gt;Master-crafted weapon: A master-crafted weapon follows the normal rules, except that you may re-roll one failed To Hit roll per turn for an attack made by the master-crafted weapon.  Master-crafted weapons are taken as an upgrade for a weapon already carried by a model and should be represented by a suitably ornate weapon on the model itself.  Note that you may not master-craft grenades!  The cost of a master-crafted weapon is in addition to the normal cost of the weapon.  However, only the actual cost of the upgrade will count against the 150-point limit on Wargear taken by a model (so a master-crafted power weapon would count as 15 points towards the 150-point limit, not 30 points).
&gt;Rod of Khorne: Made from the bone of a slain psyker and topped with the Rune of Khorne, the rod is a deadly bane to all users of the sorcerous arts.  Counts as a close combat weapon.  In addition, any model in base contact with the wielder at the end of the Assault Phase that could possibly be considered a sorcerer or psyker is slain on a D6 roll of 3+ without any save of any kind.  Only one model may be slain per Assault Phase, but it may be done in both players’ turns.  Wounds from the slain model count towards combat resolution.  A model is considered a psyker if it has a psychic power, the potential to have a psychic power, the Mark of Tzeench, or if it is required to make a Leadership-based test to use a special, “magical” ability.  Also effected are Tyranid Synapse Creatures and Zoanthropes, but not a Culexus Assassin.  Best judgement is to be used when deciding who is and who isn’t a psyker.
&gt;Slayer:  This two-handed chain axe is often taken by Khorne’s Berserkers.  It gives +1 strength, and causes the wielder to roll 2D6 + strength vs. vehicle armor.   Cannot be used in conjunction with any other close combat weapon or pistol.
&gt;Spiky bits: Khorne Space Marines often add ornate and fearsome spikes to their armor to increase their death-dealing capabilities in hand-to-hand.  A Khorne Space Marine adorned with spiky bits may re-roll one close combat To Hit die per assault phase.
&gt;Teleport Homer: Teleport homers produce a signal that can be locked onto by teleporting troops, enabling them to find a landing point with far greater precision.  If the template used by a teleporting Berserker Terminator squad to make a Deep Strike is centered on a model with a homer, then the unit won’t scatter.  Note that the homer only works for troops who are teleporting, not for those who are entering play using jump packs, drop pods or any other means.  Also not that the teleport homer must be on the table at the start of the turn that is it is used.
&gt;Terminator armor: Khorne Space Marines wearing Terminator Armor may move and fire heavy weapons.  In addition, they may move and shoot twice up to 12” or once up to 24” with rapid-fire weapons.  This does not come without a price, however, since this armor is so bulky that they never pursue when they win a close combat, they may only consolidate.  Any model equipped with Terminator Armor has a 2+ armor save and also adds +1 to his Attack characteristic.  In addition, any model wearing Terminator Armor can be teleported onto the battlefield using the Deep Strike rules, but only if they are allowed by the mission.  If Deep Strike is not allowed, then they must be set up with the rest of the army as normal.
